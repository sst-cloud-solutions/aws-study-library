- Choose the right database for your use case

---

## 1. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

### What is RDS?
- **Managed relational database** service
- Automated provisioning, patching, backups, recovery
- Multi-AZ for disaster recovery
- Read Replicas for scalability
- Supports: **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora**

### RDS Features

**Automated Backups**
- Daily full backup during maintenance window
- Transaction logs backed up every 5 minutes
- Retention: **1 to 35 days** (default 7)
- Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Backups deleted when you delete RDS instance (can retain)

**Manual Snapshots**
- Manually triggered by user
- Retention: **As long as you want**
- Can copy across regions

**Storage Auto Scaling**
- Automatically increase storage
- Set Maximum Storage Threshold
- Useful for unpredictable workloads

### RDS Multi-AZ (Disaster Recovery)
- **Synchronous replication** to standby in different AZ
- **One DNS name** - automatic failover
- Increase **availability** (not performance)
- Failover in case of:
  - AZ outage
  - Primary DB failure
  - Instance type change
  - OS patching
- **Automatic failover** (60-120 seconds)
- Not used for scaling (use Read Replicas)

### RDS Read Replicas (Scaling Reads)
- **Asynchronous replication** (eventually consistent)
- Up to **15 Read Replicas**
  - Within AZ
  - Cross-AZ
  - Cross-Region
- **Promote to independent database**
- Each replica has **own DNS endpoint**
- Use cases: Reporting, analytics, read-heavy workloads

**Network Cost**:
- **Free** for same-region replicas
- **Charged** for cross-region replication

### RDS Security
- **Encryption at rest**: KMS (must enable at launch)
  - Master encrypted → replicas encrypted
  - Can't encrypt existing unencrypted DB (snapshot → encrypt → restore)
- **Encryption in transit**: SSL/TLS
- **IAM Authentication**: For MySQL and PostgreSQL
- **Security Groups**: Control network access
- **No SSH access** (except RDS Custom)

### RDS Proxy
- Fully managed database proxy
- **Connection pooling** - reduce database load
- **Serverless, auto-scaling**
- Improves database efficiency by reducing stress
- **Reduce failover time by 66%**
- Enforce **IAM authentication**
- Must be accessed from VPC (not public)

### RDS Custom
- For **Oracle and SQL Server**
- Access to underlying OS and database
- Configure settings, install patches
- Deactivate automation to perform customization
- Better to use **EC2** if you need full control

**Write Through**
1. Application writes to database
2. Also writes to cache
- Pros: Data never stale

**Time To Live (TTL)**
- Add expiration to cached data
- Balance between staleness and cache misses
