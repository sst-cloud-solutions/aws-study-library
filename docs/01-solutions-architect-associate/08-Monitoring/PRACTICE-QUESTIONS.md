### Question 1
A company wants to monitor the memory utilization of its EC2 instances and trigger an alarm when memory usage exceeds 80%. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take?

A. Enable detailed monitoring on EC2 instances and create a CloudWatch alarm on the default memory metric  
B. Install the CloudWatch Agent on EC2 instances, configure it to send memory metrics, and create a CloudWatch alarm  
C. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to view memory metrics and manually create alerts  
D. Enable CloudTrail logging and use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query memory usage  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- EC2 instances do NOT send memory metrics by default
- The CloudWatch Agent must be installed to collect memory metrics
- Once the agent sends metrics to CloudWatch, you can create alarms
- Option A is incorrect because memory is not a default metric
- Option C doesn't provide automated alerting
- Option D is for auditing API calls, not performance metrics

**References:** CloudWatch Agent, EC2 Monitoring, Custom Metrics
</details>

### Question 2
A security team needs to identify which IAM user terminated a critical EC2 instance last week. Which AWS service should they use?

A. Amazon CloudWatch Logs  
B. AWS Config  
C. AWS CloudTrail  
D. AWS Systems Manager  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- CloudTrail records API calls including WHO made them
- It tracks management events like TerminateInstances
- CloudTrail logs include user identity, timestamp, and action
- Option A (CloudWatch Logs) monitors application logs, not API calls
- Option B (Config) tracks resource configuration, not who made changes
- Option D (Systems Manager) is for operational management

**References:** CloudTrail, API Call Auditing, Governance
</details>

### Question 3
A company needs to ensure all S3 buckets have versioning enabled and receive automatic notifications when this requirement is violated. Which AWS service should be used?

A. AWS CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs  
B. Amazon CloudWatch with custom metrics  
C. AWS Config with AWS Managed Rules  
D. AWS Systems Manager State Manager  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- AWS Config evaluates resource configurations against rules
- Managed rule `s3-bucket-versioning-enabled` checks versioning
- Config can send SNS notifications when non-compliant
- CloudTrail tracks who made changes but doesn't evaluate compliance
- CloudWatch monitors performance metrics, not configuration compliance
- Systems Manager State Manager is for EC2 instance configuration

**References:** AWS Config, Config Rules, Compliance Auditing
</details>

### Question 4
A solutions architect needs to access EC2 instances for troubleshooting without opening port 22 or managing SSH keys. Which AWS service provides this capability?

A. AWS CloudShell  
B. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager  
C. Amazon EC2 Instance Connect  
D. AWS Direct Connect  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Session Manager provides secure shell access without SSH keys or open ports
- Uses IAM permissions for access control
- Session logs can be sent to S3 or CloudWatch Logs
- EC2 Instance Connect still requires port 22 to be open
- CloudShell is for running AWS CLI commands, not accessing instances
- Direct Connect is for network connectivity

**References:** Systems Manager Session Manager, Secure Access
</details>

B. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager  
C. Amazon EventBridge with Lambda  
D. AWS Config with remediation actions  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Patch Manager automates OS and application patching
- Maintenance windows define when to patch
- Patch baselines specify which patches to install
- CloudFormation is for infrastructure as code, not patching
- EventBridge could trigger patching but isn't purpose-built
- Config evaluates compliance but doesn't patch

**References:** Systems Manager Patch Manager, Maintenance Windows
</details>

### Question 6
An application writes log data to CloudWatch Logs. The operations team needs to be alerted when the word "ERROR" appears more than 10 times in 5 minutes. How should this be configured?

A. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query for errors and manually check  
B. Create a metric filter to count "ERROR" occurrences, then create an alarm on that metric  
C. Export logs to S3 and use Athena to query for errors  
D. Use CloudTrail to track error events and create SNS notifications  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Metric filters extract metrics from log data
- Filter pattern can count occurrences of "ERROR"
- CloudWatch alarm can trigger on the custom metric
- This provides automated, real-time alerting
- Option A requires manual intervention
- Option C adds unnecessary complexity and isn't real-time
- CloudTrail is for API calls, not application logs

**References:** CloudWatch Logs, Metric Filters, CloudWatch Alarms

B. Create Lambda functions to monitor security group changes  
C. Use AWS Config with a Config Aggregator  
D. Use CloudWatch Events in each region  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- AWS Config records resource configuration changes
- Config Aggregator provides centralized view across accounts and regions
- Tracks configuration history and relationships
- CloudTrail tracks who made changes but doesn't aggregate configurations
- Lambda would require custom development and maintenance
- CloudWatch Events could detect changes but doesn't provide historical tracking

**References:** AWS Config, Config Aggregator, Multi-Account Management
</details>

### Question 8
A solutions architect needs to run a script on all EC2 instances fleet-wide without SSH access. The script should install security updates. Which service provides this capability?

A. AWS Systems Manager Run Command  
B. AWS Lambda with EC2 API  
C. Amazon CloudWatch Events  
D. AWS Config Remediation  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
- Run Command executes commands on managed instances remotely
- No SSH required, uses IAM permissions
- Provides rate control and error handling
- Command history recorded in CloudTrail
- Lambda could invoke Run Command but isn't the direct solution
- CloudWatch Events can trigger Run Command but isn't the execution service

B. CloudTrail Management Events  
C. CloudTrail Insights Events  
D. CloudTrail Multi-Region Trails  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

- Identifies anomalies like spikes in resource provisioning or IAM actions
- Management Events track API calls but don't detect anomalies
- Data Events track high-volume operations (S3 objects, Lambda invocations)
- Multi-Region Trails collect logs but don't analyze patterns

**References:** CloudTrail Insights, Anomaly Detection
</details>

B. Export logs to S3, then transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive  
C. Export logs to S3, then use S3 Intelligent-Tiering  
D. Stream logs to Kinesis Data Firehose and store in Redshift  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- CloudWatch Logs retention is expensive for long-term storage
- Export to S3 for cost-effective long-term storage
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive is cheapest for archival ($0.00099 per GB/month)
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering is more expensive than Glacier Deep Archive
- Redshift is for analytics, not cost-effective archival

B. CloudWatch Events with Lambda functions  
C. AWS CloudTrail with SNS notifications  
D. Systems Manager State Manager  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
- Config Rules evaluate compliance
- Automatic remediation uses SSM Automation Documents
- Can trigger remediation when resources become non-compliant
- CloudWatch Events could work but Config is purpose-built for compliance
- CloudTrail only tracks changes, doesn't remediate
- State Manager maintains EC2 configuration, not S3

**References:** AWS Config, Auto Remediation, SSM Automation
</details>

A. AWS Secrets Manager  
B. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store  
C. Amazon S3 with versioning  
D. AWS Config  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Parameter Store securely stores configuration data and secrets
- Supports encryption with KMS
- Maintains version history
- Integrates with EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation
- Secrets Manager is also valid but more expensive (includes auto-rotation)
- For exam context, Parameter Store is part of Systems Manager
- S3 isn't designed for configuration management
- Config is for compliance tracking

**References:** Systems Manager Parameter Store, Secrets Management
</details>
