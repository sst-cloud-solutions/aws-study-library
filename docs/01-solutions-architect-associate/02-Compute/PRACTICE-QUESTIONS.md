### Question 19
An application running on Lambda is invoked by S3 events. During peak times, thousands of files are uploaded simultaneously. How should Lambda handle this?

A. Increase Lambda memory  
B. Enable Lambda reserved concurrency  
C. Lambda automatically scales concurrently  
D. Use Step Functions  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- Lambda automatically scales to handle concurrent invocations
- Each S3 event triggers separate Lambda invocation
- Default account concurrency: 1000 (can request increase)
- No configuration needed for basic scaling

**Lambda Concurrency Types**:
- **Account concurrency**: Total concurrent executions across all functions (1000 default)
- **Reserved concurrency**: Dedicated concurrency for specific function
- **Provisioned concurrency**: Pre-initialized instances (reduce cold starts)

**When to use Reserved Concurrency**:
- Limit function concurrency (prevent overwhelming downstream)
- Guarantee concurrency for critical functions
- Prevent one function from consuming all account concurrency

**Example Scenario**:
- 1000 files uploaded to S3
- Lambda invoked 1000 times concurrently (within account limits)
- If account limit is 1000, all execute immediately
- If limit exceeded, some invocations throttled (429 error)

**Exam Tips**:

**EC2 Pricing**:
- **Spot**: Cheapest (90% discount), can be interrupted
- **Reserved**: 1-3 year commitment, up to 72% discount
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible commitment, up to 66% discount
- **On-Demand**: No commitment, highest price
- **Dedicated Hosts**: BYOL, compliance, most expensive

**Auto Scaling Policies**:
- **Target Tracking**: Easiest, maintain metric at target
- **Scheduled**: Predictable patterns
- **Step**: Multiple thresholds
- **Predictive**: ML-based forecasting

**Load Balancers**:
- **ALB**: Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS, advanced routing
- **NLB**: Layer 4, extreme performance, static IP
- **CLB**: Legacy, basic
- **GLB**: Layer 3, virtual appliances

**Lambda**:
- Max timeout: 15 minutes
- Memory: 128 MB - 10 GB
- CPU scales with memory
- Automatic concurrent scaling

**Containers**:
- **ECS + EC2**: Manage instances
- **ECS + Fargate**: Serverless containers
- **EKS**: Managed Kubernetes

**Placement Groups**:
- **Cluster**: Low latency, single AZ
- **Spread**: Max availability, 7/AZ
- **Partition**: Large distributed apps

**Best Practices**:
1. Use IAM roles for EC2 (not access keys)
2. External session storage (ElastiCache/DynamoDB)
3. Multi-AZ for high availability
4. Right-size instances (use CloudWatch metrics)
5. Use Spot for fault-tolerant workloads
6. Target Tracking for most Auto Scaling scenarios

**Next Steps**:
- Practice identifying correct pricing model for scenarios
- Understand when to use each load balancer type
- Know Lambda limitations and when to use alternatives
- Compare ECS vs EKS, Fargate vs EC2 launch types
