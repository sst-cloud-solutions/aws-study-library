A. EC2 instances with Auto Scaling behind an ALB  
B. Serverless architecture with S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB  
C. ECS containers on EC2 instances  
D. EC2 instances with manual scaling  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Serverless architecture automatically scales and is pay-per-use
- S3/CloudFront for static content
- API Gateway/Lambda for compute (scales automatically)
- DynamoDB for database (on-demand capacity)
- Zero operational overhead for infrastructure
- Option A requires some management and continuous costs
- Option C requires container orchestration
- Option D requires manual intervention

**References:** Serverless Architecture, Auto Scaling

### Question 2
A solutions architect is designing a highly available application that must survive the failure of an entire Availability Zone. The RTO requirement is less than 5 minutes. Which pattern should be implemented?

A. Single AZ deployment with automated backups  
B. Multi-AZ deployment with Auto Scaling and Application Load Balancer  
C. Cross-region replication with manual failover  
D. Single region with daily snapshots  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Multi-AZ deployment provides automatic failover
- ALB distributes traffic across AZs and health checks instances
- Auto Scaling replaces failed instances automatically
- Meets \< 5 minute RTO requirement
- Option A doesn't protect against AZ failure
- Option C has longer RTO (manual failover)
- Option D doesn't provide HA

### Question 3
A company wants to implement a disaster recovery solution for their production database. They can tolerate a 1-hour data loss (RPO) and 4-hour recovery time (RTO). Which DR strategy is MOST cost-effective?

A. Multi-site active-active  
B. Warm standby  
C. Pilot light  
D. Backup and restore  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- Pilot light maintains core services (like database replication)
- RPO: Minutes (database replication lag)
- RTO: Hours (time to scale up remaining services)
- More cost-effective than warm standby
- Meets the 1-hour RPO and 4-hour RTO requirements
- Multi-site is expensive and over-engineered
- Warm standby costs more than necessary
- Backup and restore may not meet RPO/RTO

**References:** Disaster Recovery Strategies, Pilot Light

### Question 4
An application experiences high database read load. The data is read frequently but rarely updated. Which caching strategy should be implemented to reduce database load?

A. Write-through caching  
B. Cache-aside (Lazy Loading) with ElastiCache  
C. Database connection pooling only  
D. Increase database instance size  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Cache-aside pattern is ideal for read-heavy workloads
- Application checks cache first, loads from DB if cache miss
- ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) reduces database load
- Cost-effective solution
- Write-through is better for write-heavy workloads
- Connection pooling helps but doesn't cache data
- Scaling database is more expensive

**References:** Caching Strategies, ElastiCache
</details>

### Question 5
A company is building a microservices architecture and needs to decouple services to handle traffic spikes without losing messages. Which AWS service pattern should be used?

A. Direct API calls between services  
B. SQS queues between services  
C. Shared database between services  
D. File-based communication via S3  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- SQS provides loose coupling and buffering between services
- Messages are persisted, not lost during traffic spikes
- Services process at their own pace
- Standard microservices pattern
- Direct API calls create tight coupling
- Shared database violates microservices principles
- S3 file-based communication is inefficient for real-time

**References:** Microservices Architecture, SQS Decoupling
</details>

### Question 17
An application uses CloudFront, ALB, EC2, and RDS. Users in a specific region experience slow performance. What is the MOST likely cause and solution?

A. Increase EC2 instance size  
B. Deploy application stack in the user's region with Route 53 latency-based routing  
C. Enable CloudFront compression  
D. Upgrade to Provisioned IOPS for RDS  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Regional deployment reduces latency for local users
- Route 53 latency-based routing directs to nearest region
- CloudFront caches static content but dynamic content goes to origin
- Multi-region deployment needed for dynamic content
- Increasing instance size doesn't reduce network latency
- Compression helps but doesn't solve regional latency
- IOPS doesn't affect network latency

C. IAM policies and Security Groups  
D. CloudFront with HTTPS only  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Defense-in-depth requires multiple security layers
- WAF: Application layer protection (OWASP Top 10)
- Shield: DDoS protection
- Security Groups: Instance-level firewall
- NACLs: Subnet-level firewall
- KMS: Data encryption
- Layered approach provides comprehensive security

### Question 19
A batch processing application needs to read messages from a queue, process them, and only delete messages after successful processing. Which service and pattern should be used?

A. SNS with immediate deletion  
B. SQS with visibility timeout and explicit deletion  
C. Kinesis with checkpointing  
D. EventBridge with Lambda  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- SQS supports visibility timeout (hides message during processing)
- Message only deleted after explicit DeleteMessage call
- Ensures message not lost if processing fails
- If processing fails, message becomes visible again
- SNS doesn't persist messages
- Kinesis is for streaming, not queue pattern
- EventBridge doesn't provide message persistence

**References:** SQS, Message Processing Patterns
</details>

B. Use Instance Scheduler to start/stop resources outside business hours  
C. Migrate to Serverless  
D. Use Spot Instances  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Instance Scheduler automatically starts/stops resources on schedule
- Saves costs during nights and weekends (65% of week)
- Works with EC2 and RDS
- Reserved Instances require 1-3 year commitment, doesn't stop resources
- Serverless may not support all workloads
- Spot Instances can be interrupted during work hours
- Scheduled stop/start is most cost-effective for dev environments
