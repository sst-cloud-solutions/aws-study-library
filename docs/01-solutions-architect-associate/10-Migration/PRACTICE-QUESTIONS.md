### Question 2
A solutions architect needs to migrate 50 TB of data from an on-premises NFS server to Amazon S3. The company has a 100 Mbps internet connection. Which service is MOST appropriate?

A. AWS DataSync  
B. AWS Snowball  
C. AWS Direct Connect  
D. AWS Transfer Family  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- 50 TB over 100 Mbps would take approximately 46 days
- Snowball is designed for large data transfers with limited bandwidth
- Can transfer 50-80 TB per device in about a week
- DataSync works over network but would be too slow
- Direct Connect is for ongoing connectivity, not one-time migration
- Transfer Family is for SFTP/FTPS access to S3

**Calculation:** 50 TB = 400,000 Gb ÷ 100 Mbps = 4,000,000 seconds ≈ 46 days

### Question 3
A company wants to migrate an Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The database schemas and stored procedures need to be converted. Which combination of services should be used?

A. AWS DMS only  
B. AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) only  
C. AWS SCT to convert schema, then AWS DMS to migrate data  
D. AWS DataSync to transfer the database  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- This is a heterogeneous migration (different database engines)
- SCT converts schemas, stored procedures, and functions
- DMS migrates the actual data with minimal downtime
- DMS alone doesn't convert schemas for heterogeneous migrations
- SCT alone doesn't migrate data
- DataSync is for file systems, not databases

B. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with CDC  
C. AWS Snowball Edge  
D. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- DMS supports continuous data replication using Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Source database remains operational during migration
- Homogeneous migration (MySQL to MySQL)
- Keeps source and target in sync
- DataSync is for file systems, not databases
- Snowball is for one-time transfers
- S3 Transfer Acceleration is for S3 uploads

B. Replatform to managed services  
C. Rehost (Lift and Shift) to EC2  
D. Repurchase a SaaS solution  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- Rehost (Lift and Shift) moves application as-is
- EC2 supports custom OS and drivers
- Minimal changes required
- Fast migration path
- Refactor requires re-architecting
- Replatform may not support custom requirements

A. Use the smallest instance to minimize costs  
B. Use an instance type based on the source database workload and data volume  
C. Always use the largest instance available  
D. Instance size doesn't affect DMS performance  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- Replication instance size affects performance
- Should be based on workload, data volume, and complexity
- Larger instances handle more throughput and complex transformations
- Undersizing causes slow migration and potential source impact
- Oversizing wastes money
- Proper sizing requires workload analysis

B. Microsoft SQL Server on EC2  
C. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL  
D. Amazon DynamoDB  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
- RDS for SQL Server is managed service (minimal overhead)
- Maintains SQL Server compatibility
- This is a "Replatform" strategy
- Option B requires managing EC2 and OS (more overhead)
- Option C requires heterogeneous migration and code changes

A. Full Load only  
B. CDC (Change Data Capture) only  
C. Full Load + CDC  
D. Multiple Full Load tasks  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- Full Load + CDC is the most common migration pattern
- Full Load transfers existing data
- CDC replicates ongoing changes
- Minimizes downtime
- Full Load only doesn't capture changes after initial load
- CDC only doesn't transfer existing data
- Multiple Full Loads don't capture changes

### Question 12
A company has 500 TB of data to migrate from on-premises to AWS. The internet connection is 1 Gbps, but business requirements prohibit using the full bandwidth. Which solution is MOST cost-effective?

A. Use AWS DataSync with bandwidth throttling  
B. Order multiple AWS Snowball devices  
C. Upgrade internet connection to 10 Gbps  
D. Use AWS Direct Connect with 10 Gbps connection  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- 500 TB is very large, Snowball is designed for this
- Even with 1 Gbps, transfer would take months
- Can't use full bandwidth due to business requirements
- Snowball is faster and more cost-effective for large migrations
- DataSync with throttling would be too slow
- Upgrading connection is expensive
- Direct Connect requires time to provision

A. Use DataSync to transfer to S3, then use S3 File Gateway  
B. Use DataSync to transfer to FSx for Windows File Server  
C. Use Snowball to transfer to EFS  
D. Use Storage Gateway Volume Gateway  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- DataSync supports SMB as source
- FSx for Windows File Server provides native SMB protocol
- Seamless migration path for Windows file shares
- S3 File Gateway presents S3 as NFS/SMB but uses S3 storage
- EFS doesn't natively support SMB (uses NFS)
- Volume Gateway is for block storage

**References:** AWS DataSync, FSx for Windows File Server

### Question 14
A company is using AWS DMS to migrate a database. They need to ensure the data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. How can this be achieved?

A. DMS doesn't support encryption  
B. Enable SSL/TLS for connections and use encrypted RDS instances  
C. Use VPN for all connections  
D. Encryption is automatic and cannot be configured  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- DMS supports encryption in transit using SSL/TLS
- Target RDS instances can use encryption at rest
- Replication instance can also be encrypted
- Both source and target connections should use SSL
- VPN adds security but isn't required for encryption
- Encryption must be explicitly configured
