### CloudTrail vs CloudWatch

| Feature | CloudTrail | CloudWatch |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Purpose** | API call auditing | Monitoring performance |
| **Data** | WHO did WHAT, WHEN | Metrics, logs, events |
| **Use Case** | Security, compliance | Performance, troubleshooting |
| **Example** | Who terminated EC2? | Is CPU high? |
