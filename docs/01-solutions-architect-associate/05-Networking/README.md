## 1. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

### What is VPC?
- **Logically isolated network** in AWS cloud
- **Regional resource** (spans all AZs in region)
- Control IP address range, subnets, route tables, gateways
- Maximum **5 VPCs per region** (soft limit)

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- Method for IP address allocation
- Format: `a.b.c.d/x` where x is subnet mask (0-32)
- Example: `10.0.0.0/16` = 65,536 IP addresses
- **Allowed CIDR block sizes**: /16 to /28

**Private IP Ranges (RFC 1918)**:
- `10.0.0.0/8` → 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- `172.16.0.0/12` → 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- `192.168.0.0/16` → 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

### VPC Components

#### Subnets
- **AZ-specific** (within one AZ)
- **Public Subnet**: Has route to Internet Gateway
- **Private Subnet**: No route to internet
- **AWS reserves 5 IPs** in each subnet (first 4 + last 1)
  - Example in `10.0.0.0/24`:
    - `10.0.0.0`: Network address
    - `10.0.0.1`: VPC router
    - `10.0.0.2`: DNS server
    - `10.0.0.3`: Reserved for future use
    - `10.0.0.255`: Broadcast (not supported, but reserved)

#### Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Allow communication between VPC and internet
- **One IGW per VPC**
- Horizontally scaled, redundant, highly available
- Performs NAT for instances with public IPv4

#### NAT Gateway
- **Managed NAT service**
- Allow private subnet instances to access internet
- **Created in specific AZ**
- Uses Elastic IP
- **Pay per hour + data processed**
- **5 Gbps bandwidth** (scales to 45 Gbps)
- High availability within AZ (create in multiple AZs for redundancy)

**NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance**:
| Feature | NAT Gateway | NAT Instance |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Managed | AWS managed | Self-managed |
| Bandwidth | 5-45 Gbps | Depends on instance type |
| HA | HA within AZ | Use script for failover |
| Cost | Pay per hour + GB | Instance cost |
| Security Groups | Cannot be associated | Can be used |
| Bastion | Cannot be used as bastion | Can be used |

#### Route Tables
- Control traffic routing
- Each subnet must be associated with route table
- **Main route table**: Default for subnets without explicit association

Example Public Subnet Route Table:
```
Destination       Target
10.0.0.0/16      local
0.0.0.0/0        igw-xxxxx
```

Example Private Subnet Route Table:
```
Destination       Target
10.0.0.0/16      local
0.0.0.0/0        nat-xxxxx
```

---

## 2. VPC Security

### Security Groups (SG)
- **Stateful** firewall (return traffic automatically allowed)
- Operates at **instance level**
- **Allow rules only** (no deny rules)
- All inbound traffic **denied by default**
- All outbound traffic **allowed by default**
- Can reference other security groups

Example Security Group Rules:
```
Inbound:
Type        Protocol  Port    Source
HTTP        TCP       80      0.0.0.0/0
HTTPS       TCP       443     0.0.0.0/0
SSH         TCP       22      my-ip/32
Custom      TCP       3000    sg-xxxxx (app tier SG)

Outbound:
Type        Protocol  Port    Destination
All traffic All       All     0.0.0.0/0
```

### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- **Stateless** firewall (return traffic must be explicitly allowed)
- Operates at **subnet level**
- **Allow AND Deny rules**
- Rules evaluated in **number order** (lowest first)
- Default NACL **allows all** inbound/outbound
- Custom NACL **denies all** inbound/outbound by default

**NACL vs Security Group**:
| Feature | NACL | Security Group |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Level | Subnet | Instance |
| Rules | Allow + Deny | Allow only |
| Stateful | No (stateless) | Yes (stateful) |
| Order | Numbered, processed in order | All rules evaluated |
| Default | Allow all | Deny all inbound |

Example NACL:
```
Inbound:
Rule #  Type        Protocol  Port    Source          Allow/Deny
100     HTTP        TCP       80      0.0.0.0/0       ALLOW
200     HTTPS       TCP       443     0.0.0.0/0       ALLOW
300     SSH         TCP       22      10.0.0.0/16     ALLOW
*       All traffic All       All     0.0.0.0/0       DENY

Outbound:
Rule #  Type        Protocol  Port    Destination     Allow/Deny
100     Custom      TCP       1024-65535  0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW (ephemeral)
*       All traffic All       All     0.0.0.0/0       DENY
```

## 3. VPC Connectivity

### VPC Peering
- Connect **two VPCs** privately using AWS network
- **Non-transitive** (must create peering for each connection)
- Can peer across regions and accounts
- **Must not have overlapping CIDR blocks**
- Update route tables in both VPCs

### VPC Endpoints
- Access AWS services **without Internet Gateway**
- Stay within AWS private network
- **Powered by AWS PrivateLink**

#### Interface Endpoints (powered by PrivateLink)
- **ENI** with private IP in your subnet
- Supports most AWS services
- **Pay per hour + data processed**
- Security groups applicable

#### Gateway Endpoints
- **Gateway** as target in route table
- **Free**
- Only for **S3 and DynamoDB**
- Specify in route table

Example Route Table with Gateway Endpoint:
```
Destination            Target
10.0.0.0/16           local
pl-xxxxx (S3 prefix)  vpce-xxxxx
```

### AWS PrivateLink
- Securely expose service to thousands of VPCs
- **Service VPC**: Network Load Balancer
