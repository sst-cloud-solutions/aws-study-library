## 1. IAM Overview

### 1.1 What is IAM?

**AWS Identity and Access Management** allows you to:
- Control WHO can access your AWS resources (Authentication)
- Control WHAT they can do (Authorization)
- Manage access centrally
- No additional charge (free service)

### 1.2 Key Concepts

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  Groups   →  Collection of users       │
│  Roles    →  Permissions for services  │
│  Policies →  Define permissions        │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.3 IAM Features

- **Global Service**: Not region-specific
- **Granular Permissions**: Precise control over resources
- **Temporary Credentials**: For roles and federated users
- **MFA Support**: Extra layer of security
- **Identity Federation**: Integrate with corporate directories
- **Free**: No additional cost

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 IAM is a global service - changes apply to all regions instantly.

---

## 2. IAM Users

### 2.1 What is an IAM User?

An IAM user represents a person or application that interacts with AWS.

**Characteristics:**
- Permanent credentials
- Can have console access (password)
- Can have programmatic access (access keys)
- Maximum 5,000 users per AWS account

### 2.2 Creating IAM Users

**Two Types of Access:**

1. **AWS Management Console Access**
   - Requires username and password
   - Can enable MFA
   - For human users

2. **Programmatic Access**
   - Access Key ID + Secret Access Key
   - For CLI, SDK, API calls
   - For applications and scripts

```bash
# Example: Using access keys with CLI
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
```

### 2.3 User Credentials

**Password Policy:**
- Minimum length
- Require specific character types
- Password expiration
- Prevent password reuse
- Require administrator reset

**Access Keys:**
- Each user can have max 2 active access keys
- Rotate regularly (security best practice)
- Never embed in code or commit to version control
- Use IAM roles instead when possible

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 NEVER share access keys. Use roles for EC2 instead of embedding keys.

---

## 3. IAM Groups

### 3.1 What is an IAM Group?

A collection of IAM users with shared permissions.

**Key Points:**
- Simplifies permission management
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- Groups cannot be nested (no groups within groups)
- No default group

### 3.2 Common Group Patterns

```
Organization Structure:
├── Administrators
│   ├── Full AWS access
│   └── Users: Alice, Bob
├── Developers
│   ├── EC2, S3, RDS access
│   └── Users: Charlie, Diana, Eve
├── Operators
│   ├── Read-only + CloudWatch
│   └── Users: Frank, Grace
└── Auditors
    ├── Read-only access
    └── Users: Henry, Iris
```

### 3.3 Best Practices

- ✅ Assign permissions to groups, not individual users
- ✅ Use descriptive group names (e.g., "S3-Admins", "EC2-ReadOnly")
- ✅ Review group memberships regularly
- ❌ Don't create groups for each individual user

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Groups are for organizing users, not nesting other groups.

---

## 4. IAM Roles

### 4.1 What is an IAM Role?

A set of permissions that can be assumed by trusted entities.

**Key Differences from Users:**
- No permanent credentials
- Temporary security credentials
- Can be assumed by users, applications, or services
- Use cases: EC2 instances, Lambda functions, cross-account access

### 4.2 Role Components

**Trust Policy** (Who can assume the role):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }]
}
```

**Permissions Policy** (What they can do):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
  }]
}
```

### 4.3 Common Role Use Cases

**1. EC2 Instance Role:**
```
EC2 Instance → Assumes Role → Access S3/DynamoDB/etc.
```
**Benefits**: No access keys needed in application code

**2. Cross-Account Access:**
```
User in Account A → Assumes Role → Access resources in Account B
```

**3. Service-to-Service:**
```
Lambda Function → Assumes Role → Access RDS/S3/etc.
```

**4. Federated Users:**
```
Corporate User → SAML/OIDC → Assumes Role → AWS Access
```

### 4.4 EC2 Instance Roles (Instance Profiles)

```
Application on EC2:
  ↓
IAM Role attached to instance
  ↓
Temporary credentials auto-rotated
  ↓
Access AWS services securely
```

**Best Practice**: Always use IAM roles for EC2 instead of embedding access keys.

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Roles provide temporary credentials. Perfect for EC2 and Lambda.

---

## 5. IAM Policies

### 5.1 What is an IAM Policy?

JSON documents that define permissions.

**Policy Types:**
1. **AWS Managed Policies**: Created and maintained by AWS
2. **Customer Managed Policies**: Created and maintained by you
3. **Inline Policies**: Embedded directly in a user/group/role

### 5.2 Policy Structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ListBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "s3:prefix": ["home/${aws:username}/*"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Components:**
- **Version**: Policy language version (always "2012-10-17")
- **Statement**: One or more permission statements
  - **Sid**: Statement ID (optional, for readability)
  - **Effect**: "Allow" or "Deny"
  - **Action**: AWS service actions (e.g., "s3:GetObject")
  - **Resource**: ARN of resources affected
  - **Condition**: Optional conditions for when policy applies

### 5.3 Policy Examples

**Read-Only S3 Access:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:ListBucket"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
      "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    ]
  }]
}
```

**EC2 Start/Stop Only:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "ec2:StartInstances",
      "ec2:StopInstances"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "ec2:ResourceTag/Environment": "Development"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

### 5.4 Permission Evaluation Logic

```
Decision Flow:
1. By default, everything is DENIED
2. Check for explicit DENY → If yes, DENY (end)
3. Check for explicit ALLOW → If yes, ALLOW
4. If no explicit ALLOW → DENY (implicit)
```

**Key Rule**: 🔴 **Explicit DENY always wins!**

### 5.5 Policy Variables

Use variables for dynamic permissions:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/home/${aws:username}/*"
}
```

**Common Variables:**
- `${aws:username}` - IAM user name
- `${aws:userid}` - Unique IAM user ID
- `${aws:PrincipalAccount}` - Account ID
- `${aws:CurrentTime}` - Current date/time

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Explicit DENY overrides all ALLOW statements.

## 6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### 6.1 What is MFA?

Additional layer of security beyond password.

**Something you know** (password) + **Something you have** (MFA device)

### 6.2 MFA Device Types

**1. Virtual MFA Device:**
- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator  
- Authy
- Most common and convenient

**2. Hardware MFA Device:**
- Gemalto token
- YubiKey
- Physical device

**3. U2F Security Key:**
- YubiKey
- Supports multiple root and IAM users

### 6.3 When to Use MFA

**Required for:**
- ✅ Root account (always!)
- ✅ IAM users with administrative access
- ✅ IAM users accessing sensitive data

**Best Practice:**
- Enable MFA for all users with console access
- Use MFA for programmatic access to sensitive operations

### 6.4 MFA with CLI

```bash
# Get temporary credentials with MFA
aws sts get-session-token \
  --serial-number arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/username \
  --token-code 123456

# Returns temporary credentials valid for 12 hours
```

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Always enable MFA on root account. It's a critical security best practice.

---

## 7. IAM Best Practices

### 7.1 Security Best Practices

1. **Lock Away Root User Credentials**
   - Enable MFA on root account
   - Don't use root for everyday tasks
   - Delete root access keys

2. **Grant Least Privilege**
   - Start with minimal permissions
   - Add permissions as needed
   - Review and remove unused permissions

3. **Use Groups to Assign Permissions**
   - Don't attach policies directly to users
   - Easier to manage at scale

4. **Use Roles for Applications**
   - Never embed access keys in code
   - Use IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, etc.

5. **Rotate Credentials Regularly**
   - Change passwords periodically
   - Rotate access keys every 90 days
   - Remove unused credentials

6. **Enable MFA**
   - Especially for privileged users
   - Root account and administrators

7. **Use Policy Conditions**
   - Restrict by IP address
   - Require MFA
   - Time-based restrictions

8. **Monitor Activity**
   - Use CloudTrail for API logging
   - Review IAM credential reports
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

### 7.2 AWS Managed Policies to Know

| Policy Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **AdministratorAccess** | Full access to all AWS services |
| **PowerUserAccess** | Admin access except IAM |
| **ReadOnlyAccess** | Read-only access to all services |
| **IAMFullAccess** | Full access to IAM only |
| **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** | Read-only access to S3 |
| **AmazonEC2FullAccess** | Full access to EC2 |

### 7.3 Principle of Least Privilege

**Bad Example** ❌:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

**Good Example** ✅:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-specific-bucket/folder/*"
}
```

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Least privilege = minimum permissions needed to do the job.

## 8. Identity Federation

### 8.1 What is Identity Federation?

Allows users to access AWS using credentials from external identity providers.

**Benefits:**
- Single sign-on (SSO) experience
- Centralized user management
- No need to create IAM users for everyone
- Leverage existing corporate directory

### 8.2 Federation Methods

**1. SAML 2.0 Federation:**
- Corporate Active Directory
- Microsoft ADFS
- Custom SAML 2.0 providers

```
User → Corporate Login → SAML Assertion → AWS STS → Temporary Credentials
```

**2. Web Identity Federation:**
- Login with Amazon
- Login with Facebook
- Login with Google
- Sign in with Apple

**3. AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center):**
- Centralized access management
- Integrated with AWS Organizations
- Support for SAML 2.0 applications

**4. Custom Identity Broker:**
- Your own application authenticates users
- Calls AWS STS directly
- Returns temporary credentials

### 8.3 AWS STS (Security Token Service)

**Provides temporary, limited-privilege credentials:**

```bash
# Assume role
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole \
  --role-session-name my-session

# Returns:
# - AccessKeyId
# - SecretAccessKey
# - SessionToken
# - Expiration (default 1 hour, max 12 hours)
```

**Key STS APIs:**
- `AssumeRole` - Assume a role
- `AssumeRoleWithSAML` - For SAML federation
- `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` - For web identity federation
- `GetSessionToken` - MFA authentication
- `GetFederationToken` - For identity broker

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Federation = external identities accessing AWS. Always uses STS for temporary credentials.

---

## 🎯 Exam Tips

### Must Know for Exam

1. **IAM Basics:**
   - Users = long-term credentials
   - Roles = temporary credentials
   - Groups = collection of users (no nesting)
   - Policies = define permissions in JSON

2. **Policy Evaluation:**
   - Default = Deny
   - Explicit Deny > Explicit Allow
   - Need explicit Allow to access

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Never use root account for daily tasks
   - Always enable MFA on root
   - Use roles for EC2 (not access keys)
   - Grant least privilege
   - Rotate credentials regularly

4. **Cross-Account Access:**
   - Use IAM roles
   - Define trust relationship
   - Switch roles in console or CLI

5. **Federation:**
   - SAML 2.0 for corporate directories
   - Web identity for social logins
   - Always uses AWS STS
   - Returns temporary credentials

### Common Exam Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: *"An application running on EC2 needs to access S3. How should credentials be provided?"*
- **Answer**: Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance

**Scenario 2**: *"A company wants employees to access AWS using their corporate credentials."*
- **Answer**: Configure SAML 2.0 federation with corporate identity provider

**Scenario 3**: *"A policy allows S3 access, but another policy explicitly denies it. What happens?"*
- **Answer**: Access is denied (explicit deny always wins)

**Scenario 4**: *"How to grant temporary access to an external auditor?"*
- **Answer**: Create an IAM role with required permissions, auditor assumes the role
