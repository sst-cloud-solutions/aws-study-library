## 🎯 Recommendations

### For the User:
1. **Prioritize studying**: AWS Organizations + SCPs, AWS Backup, and DR strategies
2. **Review weak areas** from practice tests (Performance domain especially)
3. **Focus on**: CloudWatch Agent, ECS networking, S3 performance patterns
4. **Practice**: Scenario-based questions for multi-account architectures

### For the Repository:
1. **Add missing high-priority topics** within next 3 days
2. **Update all FAST-LEARN files** to include new topics
3. **Create comparison tables** for service selection (already strong, add more)
4. **Add cross-references** between related topics across modules

---

## 📝 Notes

- The repository already has **excellent coverage** of core services
- Practice test results show knowledge gaps in **specific implementation details** rather than missing entire services
- Focus should be on **depth** for high-frequency services rather than breadth for obscure services
- The modular structure is well-organized and easy to enhance
