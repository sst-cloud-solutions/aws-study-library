## 🔥 AWS Organizations & SCPs (CRITICAL)

### Key Facts
- **Management Account**: Cannot be restricted by SCPs, pays all bills
- **Member Accounts**: Subject to SCPs, can be restricted
- **SCPs**: Maximum permissions (guardrails), DON'T grant access
- **Effective Permissions**: IAM Policy AND SCP (both must allow)

### Common Exam Scenarios

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Restrict all accounts to specific regions | SCP with Deny on aws:RequestedRegion |
| Prevent accounts from leaving org | SCP denying organizations:LeaveOrganization |
| Require encryption on all EBS volumes | SCP denying ec2:CreateVolume if not encrypted |
| Enforce compliance across 50+ accounts | AWS Organizations + SCPs |
| Get volume discounts across accounts | Consolidated Billing |

### SCP Template - Region Restriction
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringNotEquals": {
        "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

### Exam Keywords
- "Enforce policy across all accounts" → **SCP**
- "Cannot be overridden by account admins" → **SCP**
- "Centralized billing" → **AWS Organizations**
- "Volume discounts" → **Consolidated Billing**
- "Maximum permissions" → **SCP**

## 🏗️ AWS Control Tower

### When to Use
| Control Tower | Manual Organizations |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Quick setup (hours) | Custom setup (days) |
| Pre-built guardrails | Custom policies |
| Less AWS expertise | More control |
| Best practices out-of-box | Maximum flexibility |

### Key Components
- **Landing Zone**: Well-architected multi-account baseline
- **Account Factory**: Automated account provisioning
- **Guardrails**: Mandatory (always) + Optional (your choice)
- **Dashboard**: Compliance monitoring

### Exam Scenario
**Question**: "Company needs multi-account setup with governance, FAST"
**Answer**: AWS Control Tower (not manual Organizations)

## 🔗 AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)

### Most Common Use Case: VPC Subnet Sharing
```
Networking Account (Owner)
└── VPC with Subnets
    ↓ Share via RAM
Application Accounts (Consumers)
└── Launch EC2 in shared subnets
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Centralized networking
- ✅ No VPC duplication
- ✅ Efficient IP usage
- ✅ Simplified architecture

### Shareable Resources (Know for Exam)
- **VPC Subnets** ← Most tested
- Transit Gateway
- Route 53 Resolver rules
- Aurora DB clusters
- License Manager configs

### Exam Keywords
- "Share VPC subnets across accounts" → **RAM**
- "Centralized networking" → **RAM with VPC sharing**
- "Avoid VPC duplication" → **RAM**

## 💾 AWS Backup

### Key Features
- **Centralized**: Single dashboard for all backups
- **Policy-Based**: Automated scheduling and retention
- **Cross-Region**: Copy backups for DR
- **Cross-Account**: Centralized backup account
- **Compliance**: Vault Lock (WORM)

### Supported Services (15+)
- EC2, EBS
- RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB
- EFS, FSx (all types)
- Storage Gateway
- S3, DocumentDB, Neptune

### Backup Plan Components
1. **Schedule**: When to backup (cron)
2. **Retention**: How long to keep
3. **Lifecycle**: When to move to cold storage
4. **Copy**: Cross-region/account

### Exam Scenarios

| Requirement | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Centralized backup across all services | AWS Backup |
| Cross-region DR backup | AWS Backup with copy actions |
| Enforce backup policies org-wide | AWS Backup Policies + Organizations |
| Prevent backup deletion (compliance) | Backup Vault Lock |
| Cost-effective long-term retention | Lifecycle to cold storage |

### AWS Backup vs Service-Native
- **Use AWS Backup**: Multiple services, centralized, compliance
- **Use Service-Native**: Simple single-service backups

## 🔄 Disaster Recovery Strategies

### RTO vs RPO
- **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective): How quickly to recover
- **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss acceptable

```
Last Backup → Disaster → Recovery Complete
    |<-RPO->|<----RTO---->|
```

### Four DR Strategies

| Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost | When to Use |
|----------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| **Backup & Restore** | Hours-Days | Hours | 💰 | Non-critical, cost-sensitive |
| **Pilot Light** | 10min-Hours | Minutes | 💰💰 | Important, some downtime OK |
| **Warm Standby** | Minutes | Seconds | 💰💰💰 | Business-critical |
| **Multi-Site** | Real-time | Near-zero | 💰💰💰💰 | Mission-critical, zero downtime |

### Quick Decision Matrix

**"RTO must be under 10 minutes"** → Warm Standby or Multi-Site

**"RPO can be 4 hours"** → Backup & Restore or Pilot Light

**"Cost is primary concern"** → Backup & Restore

**"Zero downtime required"** → Multi-Site Active/Active

**"Business-critical app"** → Warm Standby

### Implementation Guide

#### Backup & Restore
- Daily backups to S3
- No running DR resources
- Deploy from scratch during disaster

#### Pilot Light
- Database replica running
- AMIs ready
- Scale up during disaster

#### Warm Standby
- Scaled-down full stack running (30% capacity)
- Scale to 100% during disaster
- Auto Scaling ready

#### Multi-Site Active/Active
- Full capacity in multiple regions
- Both serving traffic
- Automatic failover

### Exam Keywords
- "Lowest cost DR" → **Backup & Restore**
- "Core components always running" → **Pilot Light**
- "Scaled-down version running" → **Warm Standby**
- "Both sites active" → **Multi-Site Active/Active**
- "RTO 5 minutes" → **Warm Standby** or **Multi-Site**
- "Acceptable data loss 1 hour" → **RPO = 1 hour** → Backup/Restore or Pilot Light
