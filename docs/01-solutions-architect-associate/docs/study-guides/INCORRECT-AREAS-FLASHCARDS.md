## 🔴 Design Resilient Architectures (11 Cards)

### Card 1: ECS Task Definition
**Q**: What is an Amazon ECS Task Definition?

**A**: 
- **Definition**: JSON template that describes one or more containers that form your application
- **Contains**: Docker image, CPU/memory requirements, networking settings, environment variables, IAM roles, volumes
- **Purpose**: Blueprint for running containers in ECS
- **Key Point**: Task definitions are versioned and immutable

**Example Structure**:
```json
{
  "family": "my-app",
  "taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123:role/task-role",
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "name": "app",
    "image": "myapp:v1",
    "memory": 512,
    "cpu": 256
  }]
}
```

### Card 2: Route 53 DNS Failover Configuration
**Q**: How do you configure Route 53 for active-passive DNS failover between AWS and on-premises?

**A**:
- **Primary**: Create Alias record for AWS resources (e.g., ALB) with "Evaluate Target Health = Yes"
- **Secondary**: Create failover record for on-premises with custom health check
- **Key Difference**: 
  - AWS resources: Use Alias + Evaluate Target Health
  - Non-AWS: Use CNAME/A record + explicit health check
- **Cannot**: Use CNAME at root domain (apex)

**Remember**: "Evaluate Target Health" works only for AWS resources!

---

### Card 3: Lambda CloudWatch Logs Permissions
**Q**: Why would Lambda function NOT write logs to CloudWatch?

**A**:
**Root Cause**: Missing IAM permissions on Lambda execution role

**Required Permissions**:
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`
- `logs:CreateLogStream`
- `logs:PutLogEvents`

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Thinking CloudTrail logs Lambda output (it doesn't)
- ❌ Confusing X-Ray tracing with CloudWatch Logs
- ❌ Assuming permissions are automatic

**Fix**: Attach `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` managed policy

---

### Card 4: Amazon RDS Proxy
**Q**: When should you use Amazon RDS Proxy?

**A**:
**Purpose**: Manage and pool database connections

**Use Cases**:
- High-frequency, short-lived connections (e.g., Lambda functions)
- "Too many connections" errors
- Connection storm prevention
- Idle connection management

**Benefits**:
- Reduces connection overhead
- Improves failover time (up to 66%)
- Built-in connection pooling

- **Express**: High-volume, short-duration (5 min)

---

### Card 6: Route 53 Alias vs CNAME
**Q**: Can you create a CNAME record at the root domain (apex)?

**A**:
**NO!** CNAME records are NOT allowed at the zone apex (root domain).

**Solution**: Use Alias Record instead

| Feature | CNAME | Alias |
|---------|-------|-------|
| At apex (root) | ❌ Not allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| DNS query cost | Charges apply | Free |
| AWS resource | Not required | Required |
| Example | www.example.com → example.com | example.com → ALB |

**Exam Trap**: Questions showing CNAME at root domain = WRONG

**Remember**: For root domains (e.g., example.com) → Always use Alias!

---

### Card 7: Amazon SQS Cross-Account Access
**Q**: What's the best way to allow another AWS account to send messages to your SQS queue?

**A**:
**Best Practice**: Use SQS Queue Policy (resource-based policy)

**Why Not IAM Role**:
- ❌ Requires AssumeRole overhead
- ❌ More complex trust relationships
- ❌ Temporary credentials management

**Queue Policy Example**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::222222:root"},
  "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:region:111111:my-queue"
}
```

**Key Point**: Resource-based policies are simpler and more efficient for cross-account SQS access

---

### Card 8: CloudFormation Outputs
**Q**: How do you share resources between CloudFormation stacks?

**A**:
**Use**: CloudFormation Outputs with Export/Import

**In Source Stack** (exporting):
```yaml
Outputs:
  SecurityGroupId:
    Value: !Ref MySecurityGroup
    Export:
      Name: MyApp-SecurityGroup-ID
```

**In Target Stack** (importing):
```yaml
Resources:
  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      SecurityGroups:
        - !ImportValue MyApp-SecurityGroup-ID
```

**Key Points**:
- Outputs = expose values from one stack
- Export = make available for import
- ImportValue = reference in another stack
- Cannot delete exported value while in use

---

---

### Card 10: Aurora Serverless
**Q**: How does Amazon Aurora Serverless differ from provisioned Aurora?

**A**:
**Aurora Serverless**:
- ✅ Auto-scales compute capacity based on load
- ✅ Starts/stops automatically
- ✅ Pay per second
- ✅ Good for unpredictable workloads

**Aurora Provisioned**:
- ⚙️ Fixed instance size
- ⚙️ Manual scaling required
- ⚙️ Always running (pay even when idle)
- ⚙️ Good for predictable workloads

**Serverless RTO**: \< 1 minute for failover

**Exam Tip**: "Variable traffic" + "no manual provisioning" = Serverless

---

### Card 11: AWS Recycle Bin
**Q**: How can you recover accidentally deleted AMIs?

**A**:
**Use**: AWS Recycle Bin for EC2

**What it Does**:
- Retains deleted EBS-backed AMIs

---

### Card 13: Auto Scaling Termination Policy
**Q**: Which Auto Scaling termination policy should you use to phase out instances with old AMIs?

**A**:
**Use**: `OldestLaunchTemplate`

**Purpose**: Terminates instances launched from oldest launch template version first

**Termination Policies**:
- **Default**: Balance across AZs, then oldest launch config
- **OldestInstance**: Longest-running instance
- **NewestInstance**: Most recently launched
- **OldestLaunchTemplate**: Oldest template version ⭐
- **OldestLaunchConfiguration**: Oldest launch config
- **ClosestToNextInstanceHour**: Cost optimization

**Exam Scenario**: "Update AMI across fleet" → OldestLaunchTemplate

---

### Card 14: Lambda-Backed Custom Resources
**Q**: How can you dynamically look up AMI IDs during CloudFormation stack creation?

**A**:
**Use**: AWS Lambda-backed Custom Resources in CloudFormation

**How it Works**:
1. CloudFormation calls Lambda function
2. Lambda queries EC2 for AMI ID (by tag, name, etc.)
3. Lambda returns value to CloudFormation
4. CloudFormation uses returned value in template

**Benefits**:
- Dynamic value lookup
- Custom logic during stack creation
- API integration
- DRY templates (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Not**: SNS (notifications only), SQS (not for stack operations)

---

### Card 15: CloudFormation Mappings
**Q**: How do you select region-specific AMI IDs in CloudFormation?

**A**:
**Use**: CloudFormation Mappings + Fn::FindInMap

**Structure**:
```yaml
Mappings:
  RegionMap:
    us-east-1:
      AMI: ami-0123456789abcdef0
    eu-west-1:
      AMI: ami-0abcdef123456789
```

**Usage**:
```yaml
ImageId: !FindInMap [RegionMap, !Ref "AWS::Region", AMI]
```

**Key Points**:
- Mappings = static key-value pairs
- FindInMap = retrieves value at runtime
- Common for region-specific values (AMIs, AZs, instance types)

**Not**: Parameters (user input), Outputs (export values), Conditions (control logic)

---

### Card 16: Amazon Redshift AQUA

**Output**: Encrypted performance data for EC2 sizing recommendations

**Exam Key**: "VMware" + "vCenter" = Agentless Discovery

---

### Card 18: EFS Cross-Region Access
**Q**: How do you access Amazon EFS from EC2 in another region and on-premises?

**A**:
**Solution**: Inter-region VPC Peering + Direct Connect

**Architecture**:
- EFS in VPC A (Region 1)
- EC2 in VPC B (Region 2)
- Inter-region VPC peering between VPC A and B
- Direct Connect to VPC B for on-premises access

**Why This Works**:
- VPC peering allows private cross-region traffic
- Direct Connect extends private network to on-premises
- All traffic stays on AWS network (not internet)

**Not**: PrivateLink (doesn't support EFS), VPN (higher latency and cost)

---

### Card 19: ElastiCache for Redis

{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:CreateInternetGateway",
    "ec2:AttachInternetGateway"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

**Key Points**:
- SCPs apply to member accounts only (NOT management account)
- Act as permission guardrails
- Don't grant permissions (only deny)
- Applied at Organization/OU/Account level

**Exam Trap**: SCPs do NOT affect the management account!

---

### Card 22: EC2 Hibernation
**Q**: How can you quickly restore a memory-intensive EC2 instance without full reinitialization?

**A**:
**Use**: EC2 Hibernation

**How it Works**:
- Saves RAM contents to EBS root volume

- Fast resume (instance ID, IPs, volumes unchanged)

**Benefits**:
- Faster startup than stop/start
- Preserves in-memory application state
- Good for memory-intensive apps (databases, analytics)

**Limitations**:
- Max hibernate duration: 60 days
- Requires encrypted root volume
- Not all instance types supported

**Not**: AMIs (don't preserve RAM), snapshots (manual process)

---

### Card 23: Transit Gateway with ECMP
**Q**: How do you increase VPN throughput beyond 1.25 Gbps?

**A**:
**Use**: AWS Transit Gateway with ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) routing

**How it Works**:
- Create multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections
- Transit Gateway distributes traffic across all tunnels
- Enable dynamic routing (BGP)

**Benefits**:
- Aggregate throughput (multiple VPN tunnels)
- Automatic failover
- Scalable to many VPNs

**vs Virtual Private Gateway**:
- VGW: No ECMP support, single tunnel active
- TGW: ECMP enabled, parallel tunnels

**Key Point**: ECMP requires Transit Gateway + BGP

---

### Card 24: Private NAT Gateway Placement
**Q**: Where should you place a Private NAT Gateway to minimize cross-AZ data transfer costs?

**A**:
**Place**: Private NAT Gateway in the same AZ as the EC2 instances

**Cost Optimization**:
- Cross-AZ data transfer costs $0.01/GB
- Same-AZ communication: FREE
- Multiple NAT Gateways (one per AZ) reduce cross-AZ traffic

**NAT Gateway Types**:
- **Public**: Internet access, requires public subnet + EIP
- **Private**: VPC-to-VPC or on-premises access, no EIP

**Exam Scenario**: "Reduce costs" + "high traffic to internet" = NAT Gateway per AZ

---

**A**:
**Use**: AWS CloudTrail Lake

**What it is**:
- Managed data lake for CloudTrail events
- SQL-based querying
- Long-term retention
- Multi-account, multi-region aggregation

**Benefits**:
- Advanced querying (not just searching)
- Compliance reporting
- No need to export to S3 + Athena
- Serverless

**vs CloudTrail Standard**:
- Standard: Log storage + basic search
- Lake: Advanced SQL queries + analysis

---

### Card 27: AWS KMS Key Types Comparison
**Q**: When should you use Asymmetric KMS Keys vs Symmetric KMS Keys?

**A**:
**Symmetric Keys** (Default):
- 256-bit AES encryption
- Same key for encrypt/decrypt
- AWS services integration (S3, EBS, RDS)
- Never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted

**Asymmetric Keys**:
- Public/private key pair (RSA or ECC)
- Digital signatures and verification
- Public key encryption (offline)
- Use cases: Code signing, JWT tokens

**Quick Decision**:
- Encryption/decryption in AWS: **Symmetric**
- Digital signatures: **Asymmetric**
- Public key distribution: **Asymmetric**

**Exam Scenario**: "Multiple accounts" + "duplicate resources" + "cost reduction" = RAM

---

### Card 29: NAT Gateway Cost Optimization
**Q**: What's the most cost-effective NAT Gateway configuration for high-traffic workloads?

**A**:
**Best Practice**: One Public NAT Gateway per AZ with high-traffic instances

**Cost Factors**:
- **NAT Gateway hourly charge**: $0.045/hour
- **Data processing**: $0.045/GB
- **Cross-AZ data transfer**: $0.01/GB

**Optimization**:
- Place NAT Gateway in same AZ as instances (avoid cross-AZ)
- Use one NAT Gateway per AZ (not multiple per AZ)
- Consider NAT Instances for very low traffic (but less reliable)

**Don't**: Use Private NAT Gateway for internet access (it can't do that!)

---

### Card 30: Cost Allocation Tags in AWS Organizations
**Q**: How can the management account view NAT Gateway costs across all member accounts?

**A**:
**Use**: Cost Allocation Tags activated by management account

**Process**:
1. Member accounts tag their NAT Gateways
2. Management account activates tags in Cost Allocation Tags manager
3. View detailed costs in Cost Explorer or billing reports

**Key Points**:
- Tags must be applied in resource-owning account
- Management account activates tags organization-wide
- Only management account sees consolidated billing
- Member accounts can't see full organization costs

**Exam Tip**: "Combined view across accounts" = Management account + Cost Allocation Tags

---
