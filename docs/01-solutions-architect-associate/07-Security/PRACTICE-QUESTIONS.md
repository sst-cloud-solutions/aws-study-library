**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** provide centralized, preventive controls
- Applied at organization, OU, or account level
- Cannot be overridden by anyone in member accounts
- Maximum permission boundaries

**SCP Example - Enforce Encrypted EBS**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedEBSVolumes",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:CreateVolume"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "ec2:Encrypted": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCPs vs Other Controls**:

| Method | Prevention | Detection | Scope | Override |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **SCP** | Yes | No | Organization/OU/Account | Cannot override |
| **IAM Policy** | Yes | No | User/Role/Group | Admin can change |
| **Config Rule** | No | Yes | Account | Detection only |
| **Lambda** | Possible | Yes | Custom | Complex |

**SCP Best Practices**:

**1. Preventive Controls**:
- Deny unencrypted resources
- Deny public S3 buckets
- Restrict regions
- Prevent root user actions

**2. Example - Region Restriction**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Example - Deny Public S3**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock"
  ],
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "s3:BlockPublicAcls": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

**SCP Evaluation Logic**:
1. Explicit Deny in SCP → DENY
2. SCP allows + IAM allows → ALLOW
3. Default → DENY

**Multi-Layer Security**:
- **SCP**: Preventive (organization-wide)
- **Config**: Detective (compliance monitoring)
- **Automated Remediation**: Corrective (fix non-compliant)

B. S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode  
C. S3 Object Lock in Governance Mode  
D. MFA Delete  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode** enforces WORM (Write Once Read Many)
- Cannot be overridden by anyone, including root account
- Retention period cannot be shortened
- Object versions cannot be deleted during retention period

**Object Lock Modes**:

| Feature | Governance Mode | Compliance Mode |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Override** | Yes (with special permission) | No (even root cannot) |
| **Delete** | Can be deleted with permission | Cannot be deleted |
| **Retention Change** | Can shorten with permission | Cannot shorten |
| **Use Case** | Internal governance | Regulatory compliance |

**Object Lock Components**:

**1. Retention Modes**:
- **Compliance**: Immutable, regulatory compliance
- **Governance**: Flexible, internal policies

**2. Retention Period**:
- Fixed period (days/years)
- Protect-until date

**3. Legal Hold**:
- Indefinite protection
- On/off toggle
- Independent of retention period
- Requires `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` permission

**Configuration Requirements**:
1. **Versioning must be enabled** (object lock requires versioning)
2. **Object Lock enabled at bucket creation** (cannot enable later)
3. **Default retention settings** (optional, can be per-object)

**Compliance Mode Example**:
```json
{
  "ObjectLockConfiguration": {
    "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled",
    "Rule": {
      "DefaultRetention": {
        "Mode": "COMPLIANCE",
        "Years": 7
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Legal Hold Example**:
```bash
aws s3api put-object-legal-hold \
  --bucket my-bucket \
  --key document.pdf \
  --legal-hold Status=ON
```

**Compliance Use Cases**:
- SEC Rule 17a-4 (financial services)
- HIPAA (healthcare)
- FINRA (financial industry)
- Legal documents
- Regulatory archives

**Object Lock vs Other Protection**:
- **Versioning**: Can delete versions
- **MFA Delete**: Adds MFA but can still delete
- **Object Lock Governance**: Can override with permissions
- **Object Lock Compliance**: True immutability

### Question 14
A company wants to provide temporary, limited-privilege access to third-party vendors to perform specific tasks in their AWS account. What is the BEST approach?

A. Create IAM users with passwords  
B. Share root account credentials temporarily  
C. Create cross-account IAM roles with external ID  
D. Create access keys and share them  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- **Cross-account IAM roles with External ID** provide secure temporary access
- No long-term credentials needed
- External ID prevents confused deputy problem
- Fine-grained permissions with session duration limits

**Cross-Account Access Architecture**:

**1. Trust Policy** (in your account):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::VENDOR-ACCOUNT:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "UniqueExternalId12345"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Permissions Policy**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**External ID - Confused Deputy Prevention**:

**The Problem**:
- Vendor uses same role name for all customers
- Attacker could trick vendor into accessing your resources

**The Solution**:
- Unique External ID per customer
- Vendor must provide correct External ID to assume role
- Prevents unauthorized access

**Implementation Steps**:

**Your Account**:
1. Create IAM role for vendor
2. Set trust policy with vendor's account ID
3. Add External ID condition (vendor provides this)
4. Attach permissions policy (least privilege)
5. Configure session duration (1-12 hours)

**Vendor Account**:
1. Configure to assume role
2. Provide External ID when assuming
3. Receive temporary credentials
4. Credentials auto-expire after session duration

**AssumeRole Example** (vendor side):
```bash
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR-ACCOUNT:role/VendorRole \
  --role-session-name vendor-session \
  --external-id UniqueExternalId12345 \
  --duration-seconds 3600
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No long-term credentials
- ✅ Automatic credential rotation
- ✅ Auditable (CloudTrail)
- ✅ Time-limited access
- ✅ Revocable (delete role)
- ✅ Prevents confused deputy

**Best Practices**:
1. Always use External ID
2. Principle of least privilege
3. Short session durations (1-2 hours)
4. Monitor with CloudTrail
5. Review permissions regularly
6. Use MFA for sensitive roles

### Question 17
A developer accidentally commits AWS credentials to a public GitHub repository. What immediate actions should be taken? (Choose THREE)

A. Change the IAM user's password  
B. Deactivate and delete the exposed access keys immediately  
C. Review CloudTrail logs for unauthorized activity  
D. Enable MFA on the account  
E. Create new access keys before deleting old ones  
F. Check AWS Personal Health Dashboard  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B, C, E**

**Explanation:**

**Immediate Response Steps**:

**1. Deactivate/Delete Exposed Credentials (B)**:
- **FIRST**: Deactivate keys immediately
- **SECOND**: Review activity
- **THIRD**: Delete keys after creating new ones

```bash
# Deactivate immediately
aws iam update-access-key \
  --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
  --status Inactive \
  --user-name compromised-user

# After review, delete
aws iam delete-access-key \
  --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
  --user-name compromised-user
```

**2. Review CloudTrail Logs (C)**:
- Check for unauthorized API calls
- Identify scope of compromise
- Document affected resources

```bash
# Check recent activity
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=AccessKeyId,AttributeValue=AKIA... \
  --max-items 50
```

**3. Create New Credentials Before Deleting (E)**:
- Ensure application continuity
- Update applications with new keys
- Then delete compromised keys

**Complete Incident Response Checklist**:

**Immediate (Minutes)**:
- [ ] Deactivate exposed credentials
- [ ] Alert security team
- [ ] Check GuardDuty for findings

**Short-term (Hours)**:
- [ ] Review CloudTrail logs (7-90 days)
- [ ] Identify unauthorized actions
- [ ] Assess damage (new resources, data access)
- [ ] Create new credentials
- [ ] Update applications
- [ ] Delete old credentials
- [ ] Revoke temporary credentials (if role assumed)

**Medium-term (Days)**:
- [ ] Review IAM policies (reduce permissions)
- [ ] Enable MFA (not immediate priority but important)
- [ ] Implement AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual activity
- [ ] Review security groups, NACLs
- [ ] Check for backdoors (IAM users, roles)

**Long-term (Weeks)**:
- [ ] Implement AWS SSO
- [ ] Enforce MFA organization-wide
- [ ] Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- [ ] Implement secrets rotation
- [ ] Security training
- [ ] Code repository scanning (git-secrets)
- [ ] Implement preventive controls

**CloudTrail Investigation Queries**:
```sql
-- Find all actions by compromised key
SELECT eventTime, eventName, awsRegion, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
FROM cloudtrail_logs
WHERE userIdentity.accessKeyId = 'AKIA...'
ORDER BY eventTime DESC

-- Look for suspicious patterns
-- - CreateUser, CreateAccessKey (persistence)
-- - RunInstances (cryptocurrency mining)
-- - PutBucketPolicy (data exfiltration)
-- - CreateRole, AttachRolePolicy (privilege escalation)
```

**GuardDuty Findings to Check**:
- UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration
- Persistence:IAMUser/UserPermissions
- PrivilegeEscalation:IAMUser/AdministrativePermissions
- Impact:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller

**Why Other Options are Wrong**:
- **A (Password)**: Access keys and passwords are separate
- **D (MFA)**: Important but not immediate priority
- **F (PHD)**: Doesn't relate to credential exposure

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. Use **IAM roles** for applications
3. Implement **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Parameter Store**
4. Use **git-secrets** or **git-hound** to scan repositories
5. Enable **AWS GuardDuty** for detection
6. Rotate credentials regularly
7. Use **short-lived credentials** (STS)
8. Implement **AWS SSO** for users

### Question 18
A company wants to ensure data encryption in transit between their on-premises data center and AWS. Which connectivity option provides encryption by default?

A. AWS Direct Connect  
B. AWS Site-to-Site VPN  
C. Internet Gateway  
D. AWS PrivateLink  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** uses IPsec to encrypt data in transit
- Encryption is built-in and automatic
- No additional configuration needed for encryption

**Connectivity Options Comparison**:

| Option | Encryption | Speed | Setup | Cost |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|------|
| **Site-to-Site VPN** | Yes (IPsec) | Up to 1.25 Gbps | Minutes | Low |
| **Direct Connect** | No (but can add) | 1-100 Gbps | Weeks | High |
| **DX + VPN** | Yes | 1-100 Gbps | Weeks | High |
| **Internet** | HTTPS only | Variable | Immediate | Very low |

**Site-to-Site VPN Features**:

**1. Encryption**:
- IPsec tunnel
- AES-256-GCM or AES-128-GCM encryption
- SHA-2 hashing
- DH (Diffie-Hellman) groups

**2. Redundancy**:
- AWS provides 2 VPN tunnels per connection
- Active/passive or active/active
- Multi-AZ availability

**3. Dynamic Routing**:
- BGP support
- Automatic failover
- Route propagation

**VPN Configuration**:
```json
{
  "VPNConnection": {
    "IKEVersions": ["ikev2"],
    "Phase1EncryptionAlgorithms": ["AES256-GCM-16"],
    "Phase1IntegrityAlgorithms": ["SHA2-256"],
    "Phase1DHGroupNumbers": [14],
    "Phase2EncryptionAlgorithms": ["AES256-GCM-16"],
    "Phase2IntegrityAlgorithms": ["SHA2-256"]
  }
}
```

**Direct Connect Encryption**:

**Option 1: DX + Public VIF + VPN**:
- VPN over Direct Connect
- Encrypted but complex

**Option 2: DX + VPN (Separate)**:
- Direct Connect for primary (unencrypted)
- VPN for backup (encrypted)

**Option 3: MACsec** (Direct Connect):
- Layer 2 encryption
- 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps connections only
- Not available for all locations

**When to Choose**:

**Site-to-Site VPN**:
- Need immediate encryption
- Budget-conscious
- Bandwidth \< 1 Gbps adequate
- Quick setup required

**Direct Connect**:
- Large data transfers
- Consistent performance needed
- Can add VPN for encryption
- Long-term investment

**Best Practice - Hybrid**:
- Primary: Direct Connect (performance)
- Backup: VPN (encrypted, failover)
- Provides both performance and encryption

### Question 19
A company wants to ensure EC2 instances can only launch in approved VPCs and subnets. How can this be enforced at the organization level?

A. IAM policy condition checking VPC ID  
B. Service Control Policy (SCP) in AWS Organizations  
C. AWS Config rule  
D. Security Group rules  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **Service Control Policy (SCP)** provides organization-wide preventive control
- Can restrict actions based on VPC/subnet
- Cannot be bypassed by member accounts
- Enforced before IAM policies

**SCP Example - Restrict to Approved VPCs**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "RequireApprovedVPC",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "ec2:Vpc": [
            "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-approved1",
            "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:vpc/vpc-approved2"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCP Example - Restrict to Approved Subnets**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "RequireApprovedSubnets",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotLike": {
          "ec2:Subnet": [
            "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/subnet-12345678",
            "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/subnet-87654321"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Useful EC2 Condition Keys**:

| Condition Key | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| `ec2:Vpc` | Restrict to specific VPCs |
| `ec2:Subnet` | Restrict to specific subnets |
| `ec2:InstanceType` | Limit instance types |
| `ec2:Region` | Region restrictions |
| `ec2:Tenancy` | Dedicated vs default |
| `ec2:RootDeviceType` | EBS vs instance store |

**Multi-Layer Enforcement**:

**Layer 1 - SCP (Preventive)**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "ec2:Vpc": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:vpc/vpc-approved*"
    }
  }
}
```

**Layer 2 - IAM Policy (Preventive)**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "ec2:Subnet": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/subnet-prod1",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:subnet/subnet-prod2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Layer 3 - Config (Detective)**:
```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "instances-in-approved-subnets",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "CUSTOM_LAMBDA",
    "SourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:lambda:..."
  }
}
```

**Why SCP is Best**:
1. **Organization-wide**: Applies to all accounts
2. **Preventive**: Blocks before creation
3. **Cannot override**: Even admins cannot bypass
4. **Centralized**: Managed from master account
5. **Inherited**: Applied to OUs and child accounts

**Comparison**:
- **SCP**: Preventive, organization-wide, cannot override
- **IAM**: Preventive, account-level, admins can change
- **Config**: Detective, alerts after creation
- **Security Groups**: Network-level, not launch control

### Question 20
A company needs to monitor and respond to unusual API activity patterns that might indicate compromised credentials. Which service combination is MOST effective?

A. CloudTrail + CloudWatch Logs  
B. GuardDuty + EventBridge + Lambda  
C. Config + SNS  
D. Inspector + Security Hub  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **GuardDuty** uses ML to detect unusual API activity automatically
- **EventBridge** routes findings to automated response
- **Lambda** executes remediation actions
- Fully automated threat detection and response

**Automated Threat Response Architecture**:

```
CloudTrail Events (API calls)
      ↓
GuardDuty (ML-based analysis)
      ↓
Finding: UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller
      ↓
EventBridge Rule
      ↓
Lambda Function
      ↓
Automated Response:
  - Isolate instance
  - Disable credentials
  - Create snapshot
  - Send SNS notification
  - Create support ticket
```

**GuardDuty Finding Example**:
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "2.0",
  "accountId": "123456789012",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "partition": "aws",
  "id": "finding-id",
  "arn": "arn:aws:guardduty:...",
  "type": "UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller.Custom",
  "service": {
    "serviceName": "guardduty",
    "detectorId": "detector-id",
    "action": {
      "actionType": "AWS_API_CALL",
      "awsApiCallAction": {
        "api": "RunInstances",
        "serviceName": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
        "callerType": "Remote IP",
        "remoteIpDetails": {
          "ipAddressV4": "198.51.100.0",
          "organization": {
            "isp": "Malicious ISP"
          },
          "geoLocation": {
            "lat": 39.0,
            "lon": -77.0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "severity": 8,
  "title": "API call originated from a known malicious IP address",
  "description": "API RunInstances was invoked from a known malicious IP address"
}
```

**EventBridge Rule** (routes GuardDuty findings):
```json
{
  "source": ["aws.guardduty"],
  "detail-type": ["GuardDuty Finding"],
  "detail": {
    "severity": [7, 8, 9],
    "type": [
      "UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller",
      "UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration",
      "PrivilegeEscalation:IAMUser/AdministrativePermissions"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Lambda Response Function** (Python example):
```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    finding = event['detail']
    finding_type = finding['type']
    severity = finding['severity']
    
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
    
    # Extract compromised credentials
    if 'resource' in finding:
        resource = finding['resource']
        
        # If IAM user compromised
        if resource['resourceType'] == 'AccessKey':
            access_key_id = resource['accessKeyDetails']['accessKeyId']
            user_name = resource['accessKeyDetails']['userName']
            
            # Disable access key
            iam.update_access_key(
                UserName=user_name,
                AccessKeyId=access_key_id,
                Status='Inactive'
            )
            
            # Attach deny-all policy
            iam.attach_user_policy(
                UserName=user_name,
                PolicyArn='arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSDenyAll'
            )
            
        # If EC2 instance compromised
        elif resource['resourceType'] == 'Instance':
            instance_id = resource['instanceDetails']['instanceId']
            
            # Create snapshot for forensics
            volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
                Filters=[{'Name': 'attachment.instance-id', 'Values': [instance_id]}]
            )
            for volume in volumes['Volumes']:
                ec2.create_snapshot(

        Message=f"""
        Severity: {severity}
        Type: {finding_type}
        Description: {finding['description']}
        
        Automated actions taken:
        - Credentials disabled
        - Instance isolated
        - Forensic snapshots created
        - Security team notified
        - Create support ticket
        """
    )
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Automated response completed'
    }
```

**Common GuardDuty Finding Types**:

| Finding Type | Description | Response |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/MaliciousIPCaller** | API calls from malicious IP | Disable credentials |
| **UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration** | Credentials used outside AWS | Rotate credentials |
| **PrivilegeEscalation:IAMUser/AdministrativePermissions** | User gained admin permissions | Revoke permissions |
| **Persistence:IAMUser/UserPermissions** | User created new access keys | Review and delete |
| **Impact:IAMUser/AnomalousBehavior** | Unusual API activity | Investigate |

**Complete Response Playbook**:
