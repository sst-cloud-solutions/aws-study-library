          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Lifecycle Actions**:
- **Transition**: Move to different storage class
- **Expiration**: Delete objects
- **NoncurrentVersionTransition**: Transition previous versions
- **NoncurrentVersionExpiration**: Delete previous versions
- **AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload**: Clean up incomplete uploads

**Transition Rules**:
- Standard → Standard-IA (30 days min)
- Standard → Glacier (0 days min)
- Can't transition backwards (Glacier → Standard)
