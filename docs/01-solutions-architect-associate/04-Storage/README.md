- Expire objects after specified time
- Examples:
  - Move to IA after 30 days
  - Move to Glacier after 90 days
  - Delete after 365 days

**Replication:**
- **CRR** (Cross-Region Replication): Different regions
- **SRR** (Same-Region Replication): Same region
- Requires versioning enabled
- Use cases: Compliance, lower latency, disaster recovery

**Encryption:**
- **SSE-S3**: AWS managed keys
- **SSE-KMS**: AWS KMS managed keys
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys
- **Client-Side**: Encrypt before upload

**Access Control:**
- Bucket policies (JSON)
- IAM policies
- ACLs (legacy)
- Block Public Access (default)

**S3 Transfer Acceleration:**
- Upload to edge location → CloudFront → S3
- Faster transfers over long distances
- Uses AWS backbone network

**S3 Event Notifications:**
- Trigger Lambda, SQS, SNS
- Events: Object created, deleted, restored

### S3 Performance

**Multipart Upload:**
- Required for objects > 5 GB
- Recommended for objects > 100 MB
- Upload parts in parallel

**S3 Select:**

**Decision Guide:**
- **SSD (gp3/io2)**: Transactional workloads, boot volumes
- **HDD (st1/sc1)**: Throughput-intensive, big data (cannot be boot)

### EBS Features

**Snapshots:**
- Incremental backups to S3
- First snapshot = full copy
- Subsequent = only changes
- Can copy across regions
- Can create AMI from snapshot

**Encryption:**
- At-rest and in-transit encryption
- Uses AWS KMS

## 📝 Practice Questions

### Question 1
**A company needs to store 500 TB of archival data that is accessed once per year. Cost is the primary concern. Which storage solution should they use?**

A) S3 Standard  
B) S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval  
C) S3 Glacier Deep Archive  
D) EBS Cold HDD

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest cost storage class, perfect for data accessed rarely (once or twice per year). Retrieval time is 12-48 hours, which is acceptable for the use case.
</details>

### Question 2
**An application requires a shared file system that can be accessed by multiple Linux EC2 instances across different Availability Zones. Which service should be used?**

A) Amazon S3  
B) Amazon EBS  
C) Amazon EFS  
D) Instance Store

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

Amazon EFS provides a shared NFS file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances across different AZs. EBS is AZ-specific and typically attaches to a single instance.
</details>

### Question 3
**A company needs to transfer 50 TB of data from their on-premises data center to AWS. They have limited bandwidth (10 Mbps). What is the most appropriate solution?**

A) Use AWS Direct Connect  
B) Upload via S3 Transfer Acceleration  
C) Use AWS Snowball Edge  
D) Use AWS DataSync

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

At 10 Mbps, transferring 50 TB would take approximately 46 days. AWS Snowball Edge is designed for this scenario - physical device shipped to customer, data loaded locally, then shipped to AWS.
