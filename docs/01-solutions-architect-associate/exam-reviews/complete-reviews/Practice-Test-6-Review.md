## 📝 Detailed Question Analysis

### INCORRECT ANSWERS - RESILIENT ARCHITECTURES

#### Question 5: Site-to-Site VPN Prerequisites ❌
**Your Answer:** A + B (NAT instance + public IP)  
**Correct Answer:** B + C (Public IP on customer gateway + VGW attached to VPC)

**Why You Failed:**
- NAT instances/gateways are for outbound egress, not VPN termination
- VGW is the AWS-side VPN endpoint
- Confused NAT routing with VPN tunnel establishment

**Key Learning:**
```
Site-to-Site VPN Components:
├── Customer Side ✅
│   └── Public IP (on device or NAT fronting it)
├── AWS Side ✅
│   └── Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
│       ├── Attached to target VPC
│       ├── Terminates IPsec tunnels
│       └── Participates in routing (static/BGP)
└── ❌ NAT Gateway/Instance
    └── Used for private subnet egress, NOT VPN
```

**Study Resources:**
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN architecture
- VGW vs Transit Gateway comparison
- Customer gateway requirements

---

#### Question 6: EBS Performance Optimization ❌
**Your Answer:** C + D (Provisioned IOPS + ELB)  
**Correct Answer:** A + C (Larger instance type + Provisioned IOPS)

**Why You Failed:**
- Selected ELB (load balancer) which doesn't affect disk I/O
- Missed that instance type limits EBS bandwidth
- Correctly identified Provisioned IOPS but paired with wrong option

**Key Learning:**
```
EBS Performance Factors:
├── Volume Type ✅
│   ├── gp2/gp3: Balanced IOPS/throughput
│   ├── io1/io2: Provisioned IOPS (predictable)
│   └── st1/sc1: Throughput-optimized HDD
├── Instance Type ✅
│   ├── Each type has EBS bandwidth limit
│   ├── Larger instances = more bandwidth
│   └── Check "EBS-optimized" specs
└── ❌ Load Balancers
    └── Distribute network traffic, not disk I/O
```

---

#### Question 25: VPC Subnet CIDR Sizing ❌
**Your Answer:** B - 10.0.0.0/28  
**Correct Answer:** A - 10.0.0.0/27

**Why You Failed:**
- /28 = 16 total IPs - 5 reserved = 11 usable (insufficient for 20 instances)
- /27 = 32 total IPs - 5 reserved = 27 usable (meets requirement)
- Calculation error on subnet mask math

**Key Learning:**
```
AWS Subnet Sizing:
Formula: 2^(32-n) = total IPs
Usable IPs = total - 5 (AWS reserves first 4 and last)

/30 → 4 IPs  → 0 usable   ❌
/29 → 8 IPs  → 3 usable   ❌
/28 → 16 IPs → 11 usable  ❌
/27 → 32 IPs → 27 usable  ✅ (meets ≥20 requirement)
/26 → 64 IPs → 59 usable  ✅ (overprovisioned)
```

**Quick Reference:**
- Need 20 instances? Minimum /27
- Always account for AWS's 5 reserved IPs
- Round up to next power of 2

---

#### Question 35: DynamoDB Change Capture ❌
**Your Answer:** B - Create another DynamoDB table for modified records  
**Correct Answer:** C - Use DynamoDB Streams

**Why You Failed:**
- Chose data duplication approach (maintenance burden)
- Missed that Streams provides ordered change feed
- Didn't recognize CDC (Change Data Capture) pattern

**Key Learning:**
```
DynamoDB Change Tracking:
├── ❌ Timestamp + Scan
│   ├── Expensive at scale
│   ├── No guaranteed ordering
│   └── Clock skew issues
├── ❌ Duplicate Table
│   ├── Extra write logic needed
│   ├── Data drift risk
│   └── Doubles costs
└── ✅ DynamoDB Streams
    ├── Ordered change feed (24h retention)
    ├── Item-level modifications captured
    ├── Keys-only or before/after images
    └── Lambda/KCL integration
```

**Use Cases for Streams:**
- Real-time aggregation
- Cross-region replication
- Event-driven architectures
- Audit trails

---

#### Question 36: RDS Parameter Group Management ❌
**Your Answer:** D - Edit the default parameter group  
**Correct Answer:** B - Create custom DB parameter group, set max_connections, attach

**Why You Failed:**
- Default parameter groups are immutable (read-only)
- Must create custom parameter group to modify values
- No SSH/file access to RDS instances

**Key Learning:**
```
RDS Parameter Management:
├── Default Parameter Groups ❌
│   ├── AWS-managed
│   ├── Immutable (cannot edit)
│   └── Template for custom groups
├── Custom Parameter Groups ✅
│   ├── Create from default
│   ├── Modify values
│   ├── Attach to DB instance
│   └── Dynamic vs static parameters
└── Option Groups
    └── For engine features (not parameters)
```

**Steps to Change RDS Parameters:**
1. Create custom parameter group (correct family)
2. Modify parameters (e.g., max_connections)
3. Attach to DB instance
4. Reboot if static parameters changed

---

#### Question 42: S3 Storage Class Selection ❌
**Your Answer:** D - Two S3 buckets required  
**Correct Answer:** C - Standard for folder A, One Zone-IA for folder B

**Why You Failed:**
- Incorrectly thought one bucket can't have multiple storage classes
- Each object can have its own storage class
- Confused bucket-level vs object-level settings

**Key Learning:**
```
S3 Storage Classes (Per Object):
├── Frequent Access
│   └── S3 Standard (low latency, high throughput)
├── Infrequent Access
│   ├── S3 Standard-IA (multi-AZ)
│   └── S3 One Zone-IA ✅ (single AZ, non-critical)
├── Archive
│   ├── Glacier Instant Retrieval (ms access)
│   ├── Glacier Flexible Retrieval (min-hours)
│   └── Glacier Deep Archive (hours)
└── Intelligent-Tiering
    └── Auto-moves between tiers
```

**Key Point:** Single bucket can contain objects in different storage classes!

---

#### Question 48: RDS Cost Optimization ❌
**Your Answer:** A - Use On-Demand instead of Reserved  
**Correct Answer:** B - Don't use Multi-AZ in development

**Why You Failed:**
- On-Demand is MORE expensive than Reserved for steady workloads
- Multi-AZ doubles costs (standby replica)
- Development environments don't need HA

**Key Learning:**
```
RDS Cost Optimization:
├── Compute
│   ├── Reserved Instances (steady workloads) ✅
│   ├── On-Demand (variable workloads) ❌ higher cost
│   └── Right-size instance types
├── High Availability
│   ├── Multi-AZ Production ✅ (automatic failover)
│   └── Multi-AZ Development ❌ (unnecessary cost)
├── Storage
│   ├── gp2/gp3 vs io1/io2 selection
│   └── Storage autoscaling
└── Backups
    └── Automated backup retention tuning
```

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**
- Multi-AZ only for production
- Reserved Instances for predictable loads
- Dev/test environments: single-AZ, smaller instances

---

#### Question 58: ECS Container Instance Bootstrap ❌
**Your Answer:** C - Task definition  
**Correct Answer:** B - EC2 User Data on container instance

**Why You Failed:**
- Task definitions configure containers, not host OS
- User data runs at instance first boot
- Confused task-level vs host-level configuration

**Key Learning:**
```
ECS EC2 Launch Type Configuration:
├── Host-Level (Container Instance) ✅
│   ├── EC2 User Data
│   ├── /etc/ecs/ecs.config
│   ├── /etc/docker/daemon.json
│   └── Runs at instance boot
├── Task-Level ❌
│   ├── Task Definition
│   ├── Container images, CPU, memory
│   ├── Environment variables
│   └── Does NOT configure host OS
└── Cluster-Level
    └── Cluster settings (not per-instance)
```

**Bootstrap Sequence:**
1. EC2 instance launches with AMI
2. User data script executes
3. ECS agent configures and registers
4. Tasks can be scheduled

---

### INCORRECT ANSWERS - HIGH-PERFORMING ARCHITECTURES

#### Question 11: S3 VPC Endpoint ❌
**Your Answer:** C - Create S3 Gateway Endpoint in VPC-B (peer to VPC-A)  
**Correct Answer:** B - Create S3 Gateway Endpoint in VPC-A with bucket policy

**Why You Failed:**
- Gateway endpoints are NOT transitive across VPC peering
- Each VPC needs its own S3 gateway endpoint
- Missed the VPC-scoped nature of gateway endpoints

**Key Learning:**
```
S3 Gateway VPC Endpoints:
├── Scope
│   ├── Per-VPC resource
│   ├── Not transitive across peering
│   └── Not transitive across Transit Gateway
├── Configuration
│   ├── Create in each VPC needing access
│   ├── Update route tables (S3 prefix list)
│   └── Apply bucket policy (aws:SourceVpce)
└── Traffic Flow
    ├── Private (stays on AWS network)
    ├── No IGW/NAT required
    └── No data processing charges
```

**Multi-VPC Pattern:**
- VPC-A needs endpoint → Create in VPC-A
- VPC-B needs endpoint → Create in VPC-B
- Bucket policy can allow both endpoints

---

#### Question 46: EC2 Automated Bootstrap ❌
**Your Answer:** D - Use EC2Config  
**Correct Answer:** A - Use User Data scripts

**Why You Failed:**
- EC2Config is legacy Windows tool
- User data is the standard bootstrap mechanism
- Modern approach: cloud-init (Linux) / EC2Launch (Windows)

**Key Learning:**
```
EC2 Bootstrap Methods:
├── User Data ✅ (Recommended)
│   ├── Runs at first boot (cloud-init)
│   ├── Shell/PowerShell scripts
│   ├── Download latest packages
│   └── Cross-platform
├── EC2Config ❌ (Legacy)
│   └── Replaced by EC2Launch/EC2Launch v2
├── Metadata
│   └── Read-only instance info
└── AMI Baking
    └── Pre-install software (less flexible)
```

**User Data Use Cases:**
- Install/update packages
- Configure services
- Register with management tools
- Set environment-specific settings

---

#### Question 49: Security Group Rule Propagation ❌
**Your Answer:** A - Takes 2-5 minutes  
**Correct Answer:** C - Changes apply instantly

**Why You Failed:**
- Security group changes are near-instantaneous
- No reboot required
- Confused with other AWS propagation delays

**Key Learning:**
```
AWS Configuration Propagation Times:
├── Instant/Seconds
│   ├── Security Group rules ✅
│   ├── IAM policy changes (within seconds)
│   └── Route table updates
├── Minutes
│   ├── DNS propagation (Route 53 TTL)
│   ├── CloudFront distribution updates
│   └── Some service configurations
└── Hours
    └── Certificate issuance/validation
```

**Security Groups:**
- Stateful firewall
- Changes apply immediately to all instances
- No instance restart needed

---

#### Question 60: API Gateway Integration Targets ❌
**Your Answer:** A + D + E (Public HTTP + VPC Link + SFTP)  
**Correct Answer:** A + B + D (Public HTTP + Lambda cross-account + VPC Link)

**Why You Failed:**
- Selected SFTP (not a supported integration)
- Missed Lambda cross-account (valid with permissions)
- Correctly identified HTTP and VPC Link

**Key Learning:**
```
API Gateway Integration Types:
✅ Supported:
├── AWS Lambda (same/cross-account)
├── HTTP/HTTPS endpoints (public internet)
├── AWS Services (DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, etc.)
├── VPC Link → NLB → private resources
└── Mock integrations

❌ Not Supported:
├── Direct database connections
├── SFTP/FTP
└── Custom protocols without HTTP wrapper
```

**Cross-Account Lambda:**
- Lambda resource policy grants API Gateway invoke
- API Gateway needs execution role
- Same region or different regions supported

---

#### Question 61: API Gateway Cache Key ❌
**Your Answer:** C - API Stage  
**Correct Answer:** D - Query-string parameter in cache key

**Why You Failed:**
- Stages separate environments (dev/prod), not cache segments
- Cache keys can include query strings, headers, paths
- Didn't recognize cache key customization feature

**Key Learning:**
```
API Gateway Caching:
├── Cache Key Components
│   ├── Request path
│   ├── Query string parameters ✅
│   ├── Request headers
│   └── Request body (limited)
├── Cache Splitting Strategies
│   ├── ?type=equity vs ?type=fixed-income
│   ├── Separate TTLs per parameter
│   └── Invalidation per key
└── Configuration
    ├── Method-level cache settings
    ├── Include parameters in cache key
    └── Per-key TTL (if needed)
```

**Example:**
- GET /securities?type=equity → Cache entry 1
- GET /securities?type=fixed-income → Cache entry 2
- Updates to equity don't invalidate fixed-income cache

---

#### Question 63: Lambda@Edge Event Hooks ❌
**Your Answer:** C + D + E (Sender Request + Origin Request + Origin Response)  
**Correct Answer:** A + D + E (Viewer Request + Origin Request + Origin Response)

**Why You Failed:**
- "Sender Request" is not a valid Lambda@Edge event
- Missed "Viewer Request" (most common hook)
- Correctly identified Origin Request and Origin Response

**Key Learning:**
```
Lambda@Edge Event Hooks:
├── Viewer Request ✅
│   ├── After CloudFront receives request
│   ├── Before cache lookup
│   └── Use: Auth, URL rewrite, A/B testing
├── Viewer Response
│   ├── Before returning to viewer
│   └── Use: Header manipulation, cookies
├── Origin Request ✅
│   ├── Before forwarding to origin (cache miss)
│   └── Use: Dynamic origin selection, signing
└── Origin Response ✅
    ├── After receiving from origin
    └── Use: Header addition, content modification
```

**Common Patterns:**
- Auth: Viewer Request
- URL rewriting: Viewer Request
- Origin failover: Origin Request
- Security headers: Origin Response
