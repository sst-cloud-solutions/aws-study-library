- Missed that missing awslogs driver prevents job placement
- Logs configuration is a prerequisite for Batch jobs

**Key Learning:**
```
AWS Batch Job States:
├── SUBMITTED → Job received
├── PENDING → Waiting for dependencies
├── RUNNABLE → Ready to run, but not placed ❌
│   └── Common Causes:
│       ├── Missing awslogs driver ✅ (Most common)
│       ├── Insufficient resources
│       ├── No internet access (for ECR pulls)
│       └── Instance limit reached
├── STARTING → Job starting on compute
├── RUNNING → Job executing
└── SUCCEEDED/FAILED → Job complete

Troubleshooting RUNNABLE State:
├── Check awslogs driver configuration ✅
│   └── Required for CloudWatch Logs integration
├── Verify compute environment resources
├── Check NAT Gateway/internet connectivity
└── Review EC2 instance limits
```

**Why awslogs Driver Matters:**

## 💡 Exam Day Strategies (Based on Test 7 Mistakes)

### Before You Select an Answer:
1. **Read carefully:** "Standalone" vs "On-premises integration"
2. **Match protocols:** NFS/SMB vs iSCSI vs HTTP
3. **Check engine support:** TDE (Oracle/SQL) vs others
4. **Verify cost priority:** Savings Plans require commitment
5. **Confirm regional scope:** KMS keys are regional by default

### Red Flags in Questions:
- "Standalone" → Rules out AD Connector
- "Single-tenant HSM" → CloudHSM (not KMS)
- "NFS and SMB protocols" → S3 File Gateway (not Tape)
- "Spiky traffic" → Spot Instances (not Savings Plans)
- "Multiple files, same URL" → Signed Cookies (not URLs)

### When Stuck Between Two Answers:
1. Re-read requirement carefully
2. Eliminate options that don't match ALL requirements
3. Consider cost/simplicity (AWS prefers managed services)
4. Trust your first instinct (you marked 16 for review, many correct)
