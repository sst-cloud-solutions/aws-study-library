## 🔍 EXAM STRATEGY ENHANCEMENTS

### 30-Second Question Analysis Method

**Step 1: Identify Constraint (5s)**
- Cost, Performance, Security, Operational, or Multiple

**Step 2: Identify Key Phrases (5s)**
- "Most cost-effective", "Minimize overhead", "Cannot afford data loss", etc.

**Step 3: Eliminate Obviously Wrong (10s)**
- Missing encryption, single AZ for HA, manual vs automated, etc.

**Step 4: Choose Best Remaining (10s)**
- Simplest solution meeting ALL requirements

### Answer Selection Priorities

1. Security over everything (if data sensitivity mentioned)
2. Managed over self-managed (unless cost prioritized)
3. Multi-AZ over single AZ (unless cost prioritized)
4. Automation over manual (always)
5. Simpler over complex (if both work)

### Red Flag Answers (Usually Wrong)

- "manually scale" or "administrator monitors"
- Self-managed when managed alternative exists
- Complex multi-service chains when simple works
- No error handling mentioned
- Missing encryption for sensitive data
- No backup strategy
- Single point of failure
