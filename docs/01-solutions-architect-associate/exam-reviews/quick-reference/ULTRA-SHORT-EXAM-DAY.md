- Per shard: 1 MB/s write OR 1000 records/s write (whichever hits first)
- Per shard: 2 MB/s read (5 consumers) OR 2 MB/s per consumer (enhanced fan-out)
- ❌ TRAP: "2 MB/s read shared across all consumers"
- Reality: Standard = shared 2MB/s, Enhanced fan-out = 2MB/s per consumer
- Calculate shards: Max(records/s ÷ 1000, MB/s write ÷ 1, MB/s read ÷ 2)

**80. Kinesis Data Streams Retention**
- Default: 24 hours
- Max: 365 days

- Viewer Request = Before cache lookup (auth, URL rewrite)
- Origin Request = On cache miss, before origin
- Origin Response = After origin, before caching
- Viewer Response = Before sending to viewer
- ❌ TRAP: "Lambda@Edge can modify cache lookup directly"
- ✅ Reality: Viewer Request runs before cache check

### SNS Edge Cases
**81. SNS Fan-Out Pattern**
- SNS → Multiple SQS queues (decoupling)
- Each queue gets copy of message
- ❌ TRAP: "Use multiple consumers on one SQS"
- Reality: Fan-out via SNS gives each service independent queue

**82. SNS Message Filtering**
- Filter policy = JSON on subscription
- Reduces unwanted messages delivered to subscriber
- ❌ TRAP: "Filtering at consumer = Same cost"
- Reality: SNS filtering reduces delivery costs

- Reality: Only frequently accessed data cached

### AWS Backup Edge Cases
**87. AWS Backup Vault Lock**
- WORM (Write Once Read Many) for compliance
- Cannot delete backups even as root
- ❌ TRAP: "Can delete backups in emergency"
- Reality: Vault Lock = Immutable, cannot override

## 🎯 EXAM DAY CHECKLIST

### 2 Hours Before
- [ ] Review this cheat sheet (15 mins)
- [ ] Review critical cards 1-10
- [ ] Light meal + hydrate
- [ ] Relax, you've got this!

### During Exam - Quick Lookup
- **VPC** → Gateway endpoints (S3/DDB), Transit Gateway (ECMP)
- **S3** → Storage classes, encryption (SSE-C = every request)
- **Database** → Multi-AZ (not readable), DynamoDB GSI/LSI
- **Compute** → ECS (awsvpc for task SG), Lambda (15min max)
- **Network** → CloudFront (us-east-1), ALB (dynamic ports)
- **Cost** → Gateway endpoints (free), manual snapshots (cost trap)

### Flag & Review Strategy
1. Flag questions with 2 close answers
2. Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
3. Watch for AWS-managed vs customer-managed
4. Read "MOST" carefully (cost-effective, secure, operationally efficient)
5. Cross-region usually means latency/DR
6. "Immediate" access rules out Glacier
