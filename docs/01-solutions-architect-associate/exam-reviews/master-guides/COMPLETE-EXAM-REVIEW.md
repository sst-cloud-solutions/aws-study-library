## 🔥 Critical Weaknesses (MUST FIX)

### 🚨 #1: Design High-Performing Architectures (43% in Test 5!)

**Critical Topics:**
1. **CloudWatch Agent & Custom Metrics** ❌❌❌
   - Memory/disk metrics require agent installation
   - `aggregation_dimensions` for ASG-level aggregation
   - Custom namespaces and metric publishing

2. **ECS Deployment & Networking** ❌❌❌
   - `awsvpc` mode for task-level security groups
   - Dynamic port mapping (ALB/NLB, not Classic LB)
   - Outposts vs Local Zones vs standard Regions
   - EC2 launch type vs Fargate

3. **S3 Performance Optimization** ❌❌
   - Multipart upload (required >100MB, best >5GB)
   - Parallel requests and prefix design
   - Transfer Acceleration for global uploads
   - Avoid LIST operations (use Inventory/indexes)

4. **Caching Strategies** ❌❌
   - ElastiCache (Redis vs Memcached)
   - CloudFront edge caching
   - DAX for DynamoDB
   - Application-level caching patterns

5. **Auto Scaling Configuration** ❌
   - Cooldown periods (why scaling doesn't happen)
   - Target tracking vs step vs simple policies
   - AZ rebalancing for even distribution
   - SQS-based scaling (ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible)

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Re-watch Module 03: Compute (EC2, ECS, Auto Scaling) - 4 hours
- [ ] Re-watch Module 09: Monitoring (CloudWatch) - 2 hours
- [ ] Hands-on: Install CloudWatch agent, publish custom metrics
- [ ] Hands-on: Deploy ECS with awsvpc and dynamic ports
- [ ] Hands-on: S3 multipart upload with parallelization
- [ ] Practice: 100 questions on High-Performing domain

### ⚠️ #2: Design Resilient Architectures (71% in Test 5)

**Problem Topics:**
1. **FSx File Systems** ❌❌
   - FSx for Lustre: HPC, S3 integration, DataSync
   - FSx for Windows: SMB, AD, Multi-AZ
   - When to use which FSx type

2. **Disaster Recovery** ❌
   - RDS read replica promotion
   - Multi-Region failover procedures
   - CNAME updates for DB endpoints
   - Route 53 health checks and failover

3. **CloudFront Advanced** ❌
   - Custom error pages (S3 origin)
   - Cache invalidation (immediate, costs money)
   - Signed URLs vs Signed Cookies
   - Origin failover configuration

4. **Auto Scaling Lifecycle** ❌
   - Standby state vs termination
   - Lifecycle hooks vs cooldowns
   - Health check grace periods

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] Re-watch Module 04: Storage (FSx section) - 2 hours
- [ ] Re-watch Module 05: Database (RDS HA/DR) - 2 hours
- [ ] Re-watch Module 06: Networking (CloudFront) - 1 hour
- [ ] Hands-on: FSx for Lustre with S3 data repository
- [ ] Hands-on: RDS failover simulation
- [ ] Hands-on: CloudFront custom error pages
- [ ] Practice: 75 questions on Resilient Architectures

## ✅ Strong Areas (Maintain)

1. **IAM & Security** (78-85% consistently)
2. **Cost Optimization** (improved to 100% in Test 5)
3. **VPC Networking Basics**
4. **S3 Security** (encryption, bucket policies)
5. **Lambda Basics**

---

## 📝 All Incorrect Questions - Quick Reference

### CloudWatch & Monitoring
- Memory metrics require CloudWatch agent (not default)
- `aggregation_dimensions` parameter for ASG-level metrics
- Query logs in Redshift console, not CloudTrail
- Use AWS Config for compliance checks

### ECS & Containers
- `awsvpc` mode for task-level security groups (not bridge/host)
- ECS EC2 on Outposts for lowest on-prem latency
- ALB or NLB support dynamic port mapping (not Classic LB)
- Fargate limited on Outposts; use EC2 launch type

### S3 & Storage
- Multipart upload + parallel operations for performance
- S3 Inventory or DynamoDB index instead of LIST operations
- S3 has strong read-after-write consistency (not eventual)
- File Gateway for on-prem + S3 console access
- Lifecycle expiration to delete objects (not automatic)

### Caching
- ElastiCache to offload database reads
- CloudFront invalidation for immediate cache clear
- DAX for DynamoDB microsecond reads

### Auto Scaling
- Cooldown period prevents immediate scaling
- Target tracking + AZ rebalancing for balanced distribution
- ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for SQS-based scaling
- Standby state for maintenance (keeps instance in ASG)

### FSx & File Systems
- DataSync supports FSx for Lustre
- FSx for Lustre has native S3 integration
- FSx for Windows supports Multi-AZ, cross-network access

### Disaster Recovery
- Promote read replica and update CNAME (not RDS DNS)
- ELB health checks + Auto Scaling for auto-recovery
- Multi-AZ is for HA, not read scaling

### Networking
- ALB requires IGW route in its subnet
- Global Accelerator provides 2 static anycast IPs
- Public IPv4 changes on stop/start (unless using EIP)
- Client VPN for user-level VPC access
- VPC endpoints (gateway) for S3/DynamoDB private access

### Security
- CloudHSM uses EBK/PBK for backup (not KMS CMK)
- NACLs support explicit deny (Security Groups don't)
- CloudWatch + Trusted Advisor for resource optimization

### Analytics
- QuickSight for dashboards with ML Insights
- Glue Crawler to discover schema
- Kinesis Data Streams default retention: 24 hours
- Athena for serverless S3 log queries

### Serverless
- Step Functions for visual workflow (not SQS/SWF)
- Lambda needs logs:CreateLogGroup, CreateLogStream, PutLogEvents
- SNS for pub/sub to multiple SQS queues

### Load Balancers
✅ ALB: Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), host/path routing  
✅ NLB: Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), static IP, high performance  
✅ Both support dynamic port mapping for ECS

### RDS
✅ Multi-AZ: Automatic failover (HA)  
✅ Read Replica: Read scaling, manual promotion
