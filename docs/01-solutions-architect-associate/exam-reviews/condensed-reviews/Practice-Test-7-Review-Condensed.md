## 🚨 Critical Failures (17 Questions)

### Domain 1: Resilient Architectures (6 failures)

#### ❌ Q1: Direct Connect BGP Community Tags
**Mistake:** Selected Local preference BGP (not supported on public VIF)  
**Fix:** Use BGP community tag 7224:9100 for local region only  
**Key Learning:**
```
BGP Community Tags (Public VIF):
├── 7224:9100 → Local region only ✅
├── 7224:9200 → All regions in continent
├── 7224:9300 → Global (all regions)
└── Local preference → Private/Transit VIF only ❌
```

#### ❌ Q4: AWS DataSync for EFS Cross-Region
**Mistake:** Manual S3 intermediate copy approach  
**Fix:** Use AWS DataSync directly between EFS  
**Key:** DataSync = purpose-built, no public network, automated

#### ❌ Q10: Backend Security Group Source
**Mistake:** Selected public subnet IP range  
**Fix:** Use frontend security group ID as source  
**Key:** SG-to-SG reference allows dynamic instance scaling

#### ❌ Q16: NAT Gateway Cost Optimization
**Mistake:** Selected Private NAT Gateway  
**Fix:** Public NAT Gateway per AZ (eliminates cross-AZ charges)  
**Key Learning:**
```
NAT Gateway Types:
├── Public NAT → Internet access (needs EIP) ✅
└── Private NAT → VPC/on-premises connectivity ❌
Cost Saving: Deploy per AZ to avoid cross-AZ data transfer
```

#### ❌ Q19: EBS Snapshot Cross-Region
**Mistake:** Copy to S3 bucket + enable CRR  
**Fix:** Use native "Copy Snapshot" feature  
**Key:** EBS snapshots already in S3 (AWS-managed), no CRR needed

#### ❌ Q46: EC2 Network Interface for Management
**Mistake:** Different subnets for complexity  
**Fix:** Secondary ENI in same subnet with management SG  
**Key:** Same subnet works, separation via security groups

---

### Domain 2: High-Performing Architectures (0 failures!)
**🎉 PERFECT SCORE: 15/15 (100%)**

All correct! Topics mastered:
- ✅ DynamoDB + ElastiCache for session data
- ✅ AWS DataSync for EFS transfer
- ✅ Amazon Comprehend for NLP
- ✅ EC2 metadata for AMI-ID retrieval
- ✅ SQS queue depth for ECS scaling
- ✅ Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks
- ✅ S3 Select SQL expression limits (256 KB)
- ✅ Amazon Kinesis for GPS data ingestion
- ✅ AWS Lake Formation for data lakes
- ✅ Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels for wildlife

**Keep doing what you're doing in this domain!**

---

### Domain 3: Secure Architectures (7 failures) - WORST REGRESSION

#### ❌ Q6: Systems Manager vs Secrets Manager
**Mistake:** Selected Secrets Manager for AMI IDs/license keys  
**Fix:** Use Parameter Store (config data) vs Secrets Manager (credentials)  
**Key Decision:**
```
AWS Secrets Manager → Database passwords, API keys
Parameter Store → AMI IDs, license keys, config ✅
```

#### ❌ Q8: FSx for Windows File Server
**Mistake:** S3 + AD Connector  
**Fix:** Amazon FSx for Windows File Server (native AD integration)  
**Key:** AD Connector = proxy, not file server

#### ❌ Q30: EC2 Networking awsvpc Mode
**Mistake:** Selected host networking mode  
**Fix:** awsvpc mode gives each task separate ENI + security group  
**Key:** awsvpc = granular network monitoring per task

#### ❌ Q34: Oracle RDS TDE with CloudHSM
**Mistake:** Selected MariaDB  
**Fix:** Oracle or SQL Server (only engines supporting TDE)  
**Key Learning:**
```
RDS TDE Support:
├── Oracle Enterprise Edition ✅
├── SQL Server Enterprise Edition ✅
└── MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL ❌
```

#### ❌ Q35: Redshift Enable Encryption
**Mistake:** Create new cluster and migrate  
**Fix:** Enable encryption on existing cluster (modern feature)  
**Key:** Redshift auto-migrates data when enabling encryption (since 2019)

#### ❌ Q37: CloudFront Signed Cookies
**Mistake:** "S3 Signed Cookies" (doesn't exist!)  
**Fix:** CloudFront Signed Cookies for multiple files  
**Key Decision:**
```
CloudFront Signed URLs → Single file access
CloudFront Signed Cookies → Multiple files, same URL ✅
S3 Presigned URLs → Direct S3 access (bypasses CF)
```

#### ❌ Q41: KMS Multi-Region Keys
**Mistake:** Thought KMS keys are global  
**Fix:** Keys are region-specific; use Multi-Region Keys for global apps  
**Key Learning:**
```
KMS Architecture:
├── Single-Region Keys (default) → Region-locked
├── Multi-Region Keys → Same key ID across regions ✅
└── CRITICAL: Keys are NEVER global by default!
```

---

### Domain 4: Cost-Optimized Architectures (4 failures)

#### ❌ Q23: Spot Instances vs Savings Plans
**Mistake:** Selected Savings Plans for spiky traffic  
**Fix:** Use Spot Instances (up to 90% off, fault-tolerant)  
**Key Decision Matrix:**
```
Workload Type → Best Option → Discount
─────────────────────────────────────────
Steady baseline → Reserved/Savings → 72%
Spiky + fault-tolerant → Spot ✅ → 90%
Unpredictable → On-Demand → 0%
```

#### ❌ Q42: EBS Snapshot Archive (Got correct, but marked for review)
**Learning:** EBS Snapshot Archive = 75% cost savings for long-term retention  
**Key:** Use for compliance, rarely accessed backups (24-72h restore)

#### ❌ Q47: AWS Batch Job Stuck in RUNNABLE
**Mistake:** Selected "use ECS-optimized AMI"  
**Fix:** Ensure awslogs driver is configured  
**Key:** Missing awslogs driver prevents job placement (even with resources)

#### ❌ Q50: EC2 Instance Savings Plan vs Compute
**Mistake:** Selected Compute Savings Plan  
**Fix:** EC2 Instance Savings Plan (72% vs 66% discount)  
**Key Learning:**
```
Savings Plans Comparison:
├── EC2 Instance → 72% discount ✅ (same family)
└── Compute → 66% discount (flexibility across families)

Question: "4 M5.large, very consistent, max savings"
Answer: EC2 Instance Savings Plan ✅
```

## 🗂️ Essential Flashcards (Create These!)

### Front: KMS Multi-Region Keys
**Back:** Keys are region-specific by default. Multi-Region Keys allow same key ID across regions for global apps. Reduces latency by using local replica.

### Front: Simple AD vs AD Connector
**Back:** Simple AD = standalone Samba-based AD (\<500 users, $36/mo). AD Connector = proxy to on-premises AD (requires existing AD). Use Simple AD when no on-prem AD exists.

### Front: Public vs Private NAT Gateway
**Back:** Public NAT = Internet access (needs EIP, public subnet). Private NAT = VPC/on-prem connectivity (no EIP, private subnet). Deploy Public NAT per AZ to save cross-AZ charges.

### Front: TDE Support in RDS
**Back:** Only Oracle Enterprise Edition and SQL Server Enterprise Edition support Transparent Data Encryption. NOT supported: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Aurora.

### Front: Spot vs Savings Plans
**Back:** Spot = 90% off, fault-tolerant, spiky workload. EC2 Instance SP = 72% off, same family, steady. Compute SP = 66% off, flexible families. Savings Plans require commitment (not for spikes).

### Front: S3 File Gateway vs Tape Gateway
**Back:** S3 File Gateway = NFS/SMB protocols → S3 storage. Tape Gateway = iSCSI-VTL → S3 Glacier (tape backup replacement). Different protocols and use cases!

### Front: CloudFront Signed Cookies vs URLs
**Back:** Signed Cookies = multiple files, URL stays same (e.g., stock photo library). Signed URLs = single file access, URL changes per user. "S3 Signed Cookies" doesn't exist!

### Front: Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager
**Back:** Parameter Store = config data (AMI IDs, license keys, settings). Secrets Manager = credentials (DB passwords, API keys) with rotation. Parameter Store is often free!

## 💡 Quick Reference - Top Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Common Wrong Assumptions (Fix These!)
1. "KMS keys are global" → NO! Region-specific by default
2. "S3 Signed Cookies exist" → NO! CloudFront Signed Cookies
3. "NAT Gateway = all types internet access" → NO! Public only
4. "All RDS engines support TDE" → NO! Oracle/SQL only
5. "Savings Plans for spiky traffic" → NO! Requires commitment
6. "AD Connector = standalone AD" → NO! Requires on-prem AD
7. "Secrets Manager for AMI IDs" → NO! Use Parameter Store
8. "EBS snapshots need S3 CRR" → NO! Native copy feature

### ✅ Decision-Making Shortcuts
- **Multiple files, same URL?** → CloudFront Signed Cookies
- **AMI IDs, license keys?** → Parameter Store
- **\<500 users, no on-prem AD?** → Simple AD
- **Spiky + fault-tolerant?** → Spot Instances
- **Internet from private subnet?** → Public NAT Gateway
- **NFS/SMB to S3?** → S3 File Gateway
- **Global app encryption?** → KMS Multi-Region Keys
