## 1. AWS Global Infrastructure

### 1.1 Regions

**What is a Region?**
- A geographical area containing multiple Availability Zones
- Completely independent and isolated from other regions
- Currently 30+ regions globally

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each region has a unique code (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`)
- Data doesn't leave a region unless you explicitly configure it
- Pricing varies by region
- Not all services are available in all regions

**How to Choose a Region:**
```
Consider these factors:
1. Compliance - Data sovereignty requirements
2. Proximity - Latency to end users
3. Available Services - Not all services in all regions
4. Pricing - Costs vary by region
```

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Choose the region closest to your users to minimize latency.

### 1.2 Availability Zones (AZs)

**What is an Availability Zone?**
- One or more discrete data centers within a region
- Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking
- Connected to other AZs via low-latency links
- Each region has minimum 3 AZs (most have 3-6)

**Key Characteristics:**
- AZs are named: `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`, etc.
- Isolated from failures in other AZs
- Enables high availability and fault tolerance
- ~100 total AZs globally

**Multi-AZ Deployment Pattern:**
```
Region: us-east-1
├── AZ: us-east-1a
│   ├── Application Server 1
│   └── Database Primary
├── AZ: us-east-1b
│   ├── Application Server 2
│   └── Database Standby
└── AZ: us-east-1c
    └── Application Server 3
```

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Always deploy across multiple AZs for high availability.

### 1.3 Edge Locations

**What is an Edge Location?**
- Endpoints for AWS services like CloudFront and Route 53
- Used to cache content closer to end users
- 400+ edge locations globally (more than Regions)
- Part of the AWS Global Network

**Use Cases:**
- Content Delivery Network (CloudFront)
- DNS service (Route 53)
- AWS WAF and Shield
- Lambda@Edge

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Edge Locations ≠ Regions. They're for caching and low-latency access.

### 1.4 Local Zones

**What is a Local Zone?**
- Extension of an AWS region closer to large population centers
- Provides single-digit millisecond latency to end users
- Useful for latency-sensitive applications

**Example:** Los Angeles Local Zone extends `us-west-2` region

### 1.5 Wavelength Zones

**What is a Wavelength Zone?**
- AWS infrastructure embedded within telecom providers' 5G networks
- Enables ultra-low latency for mobile and edge devices
- Use cases: AR/VR, real-time gaming, autonomous vehicles

## 5. AWS Account Management

### 5.1 AWS Account Basics

**Root User:**
- Created when AWS account is created
- Has complete access to all resources
- **NEVER use for everyday tasks**
- Enable MFA immediately

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Create IAM users for daily tasks
- ✅ Enable MFA on root account
- ✅ Use strong password
- ✅ Don't share root credentials
- ✅ Delete root access keys

### 5.2 AWS Organizations

**What is AWS Organizations?**
- **Centrally manage multiple AWS accounts**
- Consolidated billing across all accounts
- Hierarchical account structure with Organizational Units (OUs)
- Automate account creation
- Apply policies across accounts

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consolidated Billing**: Single payment method, volume discounts
- ✅ **Centralized Management**: Control access and security policies
- ✅ **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Set permission guardrails
- ✅ **Account Automation**: Programmatic account creation
- ✅ **Cost Allocation**: Tag-based cost tracking across accounts

#### AWS Organizations Structure

```
Root (Organization)
│
├── Management Account (Master Account)
│   └── Pays all charges, full admin access
│
├── Production OU
│   ├── Prod-App Account
│   ├── Prod-DB Account
│   └── Prod-Network Account
│
├── Development OU
│   ├── Dev Account 1
│   ├── Dev Account 2
│   └── Test Account
│
├── Security OU
│   ├── Security Audit Account
│   └── Log Archive Account
│
└── Sandbox OU
    ├── Sandbox 1
    └── Sandbox 2
```

**Organizational Unit (OU) Best Practices:**
- Group accounts by function (Production, Development, Security)
- Nest OUs up to 5 levels deep
- Apply different policies to different OUs
- Use meaningful names for easy management

#### Service Control Policies (SCPs)

**What are SCPs?**
- JSON policies that define **maximum permissions** for accounts
- Act as **guardrails** (don't grant permissions, only limit them)
- Applied at: Organization Root, OU, or individual Account level
- Inherited down the OU hierarchy

**Important SCP Rules:**
- ❌ SCPs **DO NOT** affect the Management Account
- ❌ SCPs **DO NOT** grant permissions (only restrict)
- ✅ SCPs override IAM policies in member accounts
- ✅ Effective permissions = IAM permissions AND SCP permissions

**SCP Example 1: Deny All Access to Specific Region**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyAllOutsideUSEast1",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCP Example 2: Require Encryption for EBS Volumes**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedEBS",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:RunInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "ec2:Encrypted": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCP Example 3: Prevent Users from Leaving Organization**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "organizations:LeaveOrganization",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Common SCP Use Cases:**
- Restrict services to specific regions (data sovereignty)
- Enforce encryption requirements
- Prevent deletion of CloudTrail logs
- Restrict instance types to approved list
- Deny public S3 buckets
- Prevent leaving the organization

**SCP Evaluation Logic:**
```
User attempts action
    ↓
Is there an explicit Deny in SCP? → YES → ❌ DENY
    ↓ NO
Is there an explicit Allow in SCP? → YES → Check IAM Policy
    ↓ NO                                      ↓
❌ DENY (implicit)                    Is there Allow in IAM? → YES → ✅ ALLOW
                                            ↓ NO
                                        ❌ DENY
```

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 Remember: SCPs affect ALL users and roles in member accounts, but NOT the management account!

#### AWS Control Tower

**What is AWS Control Tower?**

| Compliance Dashboard | No | Yes |
| Use Case | Full control | Quick setup with best practices |

**When to Use:**
- **Control Tower**: Quick setup, governance out-of-the-box, less AWS experience
- **Organizations**: Maximum flexibility, custom policies, experienced teams

#### AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)

**What is AWS RAM?**
- **Share AWS resources across accounts** without duplicating them
- Share within your Organization or with specific accounts
- No additional charge for using RAM
- Centralized resource management

**Shareable Resources:**
- **VPC Subnets**: Share subnets with other accounts (common use case)
- **Transit Gateway**: Share transit gateway attachments
- **Route 53 Resolver**: Share DNS query resolution rules
- **License Manager**: Share software licenses
- **Aurora DB Clusters**: Share Aurora DB clusters
- **Resource Groups**: Share resource groups
- **Capacity Reservations**: Share EC2 capacity reservations
- **Dedicated Hosts**: Share dedicated hosts
- **Prefix Lists**: Share managed prefix lists

**Common Use Case: VPC Subnet Sharing**
```
Account A (Networking Account)
└── VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
    ├── Private Subnet 1 (shared via RAM)
    └── Private Subnet 2 (shared via RAM)
        ↓
        RAM Resource Share
        ↓
Account B (Application Account)
└── EC2 instances launch in Account A's subnets
    (but owned by Account B)
```

**Benefits of Subnet Sharing:**
- ✅ Centralized network management
- ✅ Reduced number of VPCs
- ✅ Simplified network architecture
- ✅ Lower operational overhead
- ✅ Efficient use of IP addresses

**RAM Sharing Process:**
1. Resource owner creates a resource share
2. Specify which resources to share
3. Specify which accounts/OUs can access
4. Recipients accept the share (if outside Organization)
5. Recipients can use resources (but not modify/delete)

**Exam Tip**: 🎯 RAM is commonly tested with VPC subnet sharing scenarios for centralized networking!

#### Consolidated Billing

**How Consolidated Billing Works:**
- Single payment method for all accounts in Organization
- Management account pays all charges
- Member accounts cannot change billing settings
- Combined usage for volume discounts

**Volume Discount Benefits:**
```
Account 1: Uses 500 GB S3 storage
Account 2: Uses 800 GB S3 storage
Account 3: Uses 700 GB S3 storage
Total: 2,000 GB → Higher volume pricing tier applies
```

**Cost Allocation Tags:**
- Tag resources across accounts
- Track costs by project, department, environment
- Generate detailed cost reports
- Examples: `Project:WebApp`, `Environment:Production`, `CostCenter:Engineering`
