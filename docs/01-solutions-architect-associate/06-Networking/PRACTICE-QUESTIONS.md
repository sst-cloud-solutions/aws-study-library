**Explanation:**
- **Amazon VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud) provides isolated network environment
- Logically isolated section of AWS Cloud
- Complete control over networking (IP ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways)
- Can create public and private subnets

**VPC Key Components**:
- **CIDR Block**: IP address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
- **Subnets**: Subdivisions within VPC
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing
- **Internet Gateway**: Access to internet
- **NAT Gateway**: Outbound internet for private subnets

**References:** Amazon VPC, VPC Fundamentals

A. Internet Gateway  
B. NAT Gateway  
C. Virtual Private Gateway  
D. VPC Peering  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
- **NAT Gateway** enables outbound internet access for private subnets
- Instances remain private (no inbound from internet)
- Placed in public subnet
- Route private subnet traffic to NAT Gateway

**NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance**:

| Feature | NAT Gateway | NAT Instance |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Managed** | AWS-managed | Customer-managed |
| **Availability** | Highly available (AZ) | Single instance |
| **Bandwidth** | Up to 45 Gbps | Instance type dependent |
| **Cost** | Hourly + data transfer | Instance cost |
| **Maintenance** | AWS handles | Customer handles |

**Configuration**:
1. Create NAT Gateway in public subnet

### Question 3
A company has a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16. They want to divide it into subnets. How many IP addresses are available in a /24 subnet?

A. 128  
B. 256  
C. 251  
D. 254  

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
- **/24 subnet** has 256 total IP addresses (2^8)
- **AWS reserves 5 IP addresses** in each subnet:
  - .0: Network address
  - .1: VPC router
  - .2: DNS server
  - .3: Future use
  - .255: Broadcast

- **Available**: 256 - 5 = **251 IP addresses**

**CIDR Calculations**:
- /16: 65,536 IPs (65,531 usable)
- /24: 256 IPs (251 usable)
- /28: 16 IPs (11 usable)
