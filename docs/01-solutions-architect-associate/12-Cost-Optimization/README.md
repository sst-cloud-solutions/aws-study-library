## 1. AWS Pricing Fundamentals

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing
- **No upfront costs**: Pay only for what you use
- **No minimum commitments**: Scale up or down freely
- **No termination fees**: Stop using services anytime

### Key Pricing Principles

**1. Compute**
- Pay for compute time (per second or per hour)
- Stop paying when you stop instances

**2. Storage**
- Pay for data stored (per GB)
- Different storage classes have different prices

**3. Data Transfer**
- **Inbound**: Generally free
- **Outbound**: Charges apply (varies by destination)
- **Between AWS services in same region**: Often free
- **Between regions**: Charges apply

### AWS Free Tier

**Three Types:**

**1. Always Free**
- Services that are always free within limits
- Examples:
  - **Lambda**: 1M free requests/month
  - **DynamoDB**: 25 GB storage
  - **SNS**: 1M publishes/month
  - **CloudWatch**: 10 custom metrics

**2. 12 Months Free**
- Free for first 12 months after AWS account creation
- Examples:
  - **EC2**: 750 hours/month of t2.micro or t3.micro
  - **S3**: 5 GB standard storage
  - **RDS**: 750 hours/month of db.t2.micro
  - **CloudFront**: 50 GB data transfer out

**3. Trials**
- Short-term free trials for specific services
- Examples:
  - **SageMaker**: 250 hours/2 months of t2.medium
  - **Redshift**: 750 hours/2 months
  - **Inspector**: 90-day trial

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

**On-Premises Costs:**
- Hardware (servers, storage, networking)
- Software licenses
- Data center costs (space, power, cooling)
- IT staff (salary, training)
- Maintenance and support

**AWS Costs:**
- Compute, storage, network
- Reduced or eliminated on-premises costs

**RI Scope:**

**Regional RIs:**
- Apply to any AZ in the region
- No capacity reservation
- Instance size flexibility

**Zonal RIs:**
- Apply to specific AZ only
- Reserve capacity in that AZ
- No instance size flexibility

**When to Use:**
- Steady-state workloads (databases, always-on servers)
- Predictable usage patterns
- Long-term projects

**Pricing Example:**
```
t3.medium On-Demand: $0.0416/hour = $304/year
t3.medium RI (1-year, All Upfront): ~$182/year
Savings: ~40%

t3.medium RI (3-year, All Upfront): ~$109/year
Savings: ~65%
```

### 2.3 Savings Plans

**What are Savings Plans?**
- **Flexible pricing model**
- Commit to consistent usage ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years
- Up to 72% discount vs On-Demand
- More flexible than Reserved Instances

**Types of Savings Plans:**

**1. Compute Savings Plans**
- **Most flexible**
- Up to 66% discount
- Apply to:
  - EC2 (any instance family, size, OS, region)
  - Fargate
  - Lambda
- Automatically apply to eligible usage

**2. EC2 Instance Savings Plans**
- Up to 72% discount
- Apply to specific instance family in specific region
- Flexible across:
  - Instance size (e.g., large, xlarge)
  - OS (Linux, Windows)
  - Tenancy (shared, dedicated)
- Less flexible than Compute Savings Plans

**3. SageMaker Savings Plans**
- Up to 64% discount
- For SageMaker instances

**Payment Options:**
- All Upfront
- Partial Upfront
- No Upfront

**How It Works:**
```
Commit: $10/hour for 1 year (Compute Savings Plan)

Usage:
- 5× m5.large in us-east-1: $6/hour → Covered by plan
- 3× c5.xlarge in eu-west-1: $4/hour → Covered by plan
- 2× Fargate tasks: $2/hour → Partially covered
- Total: $12/hour
  - $10/hour at Savings Plan rate (discounted)
  - $2/hour at On-Demand rate
```

**Savings Plans vs Reserved Instances:**

- Use spare EC2 capacity
- Can be interrupted by AWS with 2-minute warning
- Set maximum price (optional)

**How Spot Instances Work:**
1. You request Spot Instances at your max price
2. Instances run when spot price \< your max price
3. AWS can reclaim instances when capacity is needed
4. You get 2-minute warning before termination

**Spot Instance Interruption:**
```
AWS sends notification → 2-minute warning → Instance terminated
```

**Spot Instance Termination Handling:**
- EC2 sends termination notice to instance metadata
- CloudWatch Events notification
- Use: Save work, checkpoint, gracefully shutdown

**Spot Request Types:**

**One-Time Request:**
- Instances launched once
- Request closes when fulfilled

**Persistent Request:**
- Request stays open
- Relaunches instances if interrupted
- Until you cancel the request

**Spot Fleet:**
- Collection of Spot and On-Demand instances
- Define target capacity
- Launch templates with instance types
- Strategies:
  - **Lowest price**: Launch instances from lowest price pool
  - **Diversified**: Distribute across all pools
  - **Capacity optimized**: Launch in pools with optimal capacity
  - **Price capacity optimized**: Best price for capacity

**Spot Blocks (Deprecated):**
- Reserve Spot Instances for 1-6 hours
- No longer available for new users

**When to Use Spot Instances:**
- **Batch processing**: Data analysis, image processing
- **CI/CD workloads**: Build servers, testing
- **Big data and analytics**: EMR, Hadoop, Spark
- **Containerized workloads**: ECS, EKS with fault tolerance
- **Web servers behind load balancer**: With Auto Scaling
- **High-performance computing (HPC)**

**When NOT to Use:**
- Databases (risk of data loss)
- Critical applications without fault tolerance
- Applications that cannot handle interruptions

**Best Practices:**
1. **Diversify**: Use multiple instance types and AZs
2. **Graceful shutdown**: Handle termination notices
3. **Checkpointing**: Save progress regularly
4. **Combine with On-Demand**: Use Spot Fleet with On-Demand fallback

**Pricing Example:**
```
c5.large On-Demand: $0.085/hour
c5.large Spot: $0.025/hour (typical)
Savings: ~70%

Note: Spot prices fluctuate based on supply/demand
```

- **Licensing**: Bring Your Own License (BYOL) - per-socket, per-core licenses
- **Visibility**: Physical server details needed

**Pricing:**
- Per-host pricing (not per instance)
- On-Demand or Reserved (1 or 3 years)

**Dedicated Hosts vs Dedicated Instances:**

| Feature | Dedicated Hosts | Dedicated Instances |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Isolation** | Physical server | Hardware-level isolation |
| **Visibility** | Full server visibility | No server visibility |
| **Licensing** | BYOL supported | Limited BYOL |
| **Placement** | Control instance placement | No control |
| **Pricing** | Per-host | Per-instance |
| **Cost** | Higher | Lower than hosts |

**3. Reserved Instance Sharing:**
- RIs purchased in one account can apply to others
- Automatic across organization
- Can disable RI sharing per account

**4. Savings Plans Sharing:**
- Same as RI sharing
- Applied across member accounts

**Example Volume Discount:**
```
Account A: 5 TB data transfer → $0.09/GB
Account B: 5 TB data transfer → $0.09/GB
Account C: 5 TB data transfer → $0.09/GB

Separate: 15 TB × $0.09 = $1,350

Consolidated: 15 TB
- First 10 TB × $0.09 = $900
- Next 5 TB × $0.085 = $425
Total: $1,325
Savings: $25
```

### Cost Allocation in Organizations

**Track costs per account:**
- Cost Explorer: Filter by linked account

## 9. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Right-Sizing

**What is Right-Sizing?**
- Match instance types to actual workload needs
- Downsize overprovisioned resources
- Continuous process

**How to Right-Size:**
1. **Monitor Metrics**: CloudWatch CPU, memory, network
2. **Identify Underutilized**: CPU \< 20%, Memory \< 40%
3. **Test Smaller Instances**: Validate performance
4. **Implement Changes**: Resize during maintenance window
5. **Monitor Post-Change**: Ensure performance is acceptable

**Tools:**
- Cost Explorer Right-Sizing Recommendations
- AWS Compute Optimizer
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms

**Potential Savings:**
- 20-50% reduction in EC2 costs
- Similar savings for RDS, ElastiCache

---

### 2. Purchasing Options Optimization

**Strategy:**
- Use RIs or Savings Plans for steady workloads
- Use Spot for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
- Use On-Demand for spiky, unpredictable workloads

**Example Mix:**
```
Web Application:
- Baseline (70%): Reserved Instances or Savings Plans
- Variable (20%): On-Demand for scaling
- Batch Processing (10%): Spot Instances
```

**RI/Savings Plan Strategy:**
- Analyze usage patterns
- Start with shorter term (1-year)
- Gradually increase coverage
- Target 60-80% coverage for predictable workloads

---

### 3. Auto Scaling

**Benefits:**
- Scale down during low usage
- Avoid overprovisioning
- Pay only for needed capacity

**Implementation:**
- EC2 Auto Scaling
- DynamoDB Auto Scaling
- Aurora Auto Scaling
- ECS Service Auto Scaling

**Example:**
```
Application without Auto Scaling:
- Provisioned for peak: 10 instances × 24/7
- Cost: 10 × 730 hours × $0.05 = $365/month

With Auto Scaling:
- Average: 4 instances (scaled 2-10 based on load)
- Cost: 4 × 730 hours × $0.05 = $146/month
- Savings: $219/month (60%)
```

---

### 4. Storage Optimization

**S3 Lifecycle Policies:**
- Transition to cheaper storage classes
- Delete old objects automatically

**Example Policy:**
```
Day 0-30: S3 Standard
Day 30-90: S3 Standard-IA
Day 90-365: S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
Day 365+: S3 Glacier Deep Archive or delete
```

**EBS Optimization:**
- Delete unused volumes
- Create snapshots and delete old volumes
- Use gp3 instead of gp2 (lower cost, better performance)
- Delete old snapshots

**RDS Storage:**
- Delete unnecessary automated backups
- Use Aurora Serverless for variable workloads
- Archive old data to S3

---

### 5. Network Optimization

**Reduce Data Transfer Costs:**
- Use CloudFront for content delivery
- Keep resources in same region
- Use VPC endpoints instead of NAT Gateways for AWS services
- Compress data before transfer

**Example:**
```
Without CloudFront:
- 100 TB/month from EC2 to internet
- Cost: 100,000 GB × $0.09 = $9,000

With CloudFront:
- EC2 to CloudFront: Free (same region)
- CloudFront to internet: 100,000 GB × $0.085 = $8,500
- Savings: $500/month
```

---

### 6. Serverless Architectures

**Benefits:**
- Pay only for actual usage
- No idle capacity costs
- Automatic scaling

**Serverless Options:**
- Lambda instead of EC2
- Aurora Serverless instead of RDS
- DynamoDB On-Demand instead of provisioned
- Fargate instead of EC2 for containers

**Example:**
```
API Backend:
- EC2 (t3.medium 24/7): $30/month minimum
- Lambda: $0 (within free tier for low traffic)
  Or $5-10/month for moderate traffic
```

---

### 7. Delete Unused Resources

**Common Waste:**
- Stopped but not terminated EC2 instances (EBS charges)
- Unattached EBS volumes
- Old snapshots
- Unused Elastic IPs
- Old AMIs
- Idle Load Balancers
- Underutilized RDS instances

**Cleanup Process:**
- Use AWS Config to identify unused resources
- Implement tagging to track resource owners
- Automated cleanup with Lambda
